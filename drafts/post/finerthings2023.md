description: "Third in a series of rambling reviews about records I've listened to, games I've played, books and movies I've enjoyed, and pipe tobaccos I've smoked. Yeah, yeah, I know the last one was in, like, May. It's been a weird fuckin' year, man. Buckle in; we've got a lot of ground to cover."

With that stated, I have listened to a whole lot of new records and watched a bunch of new shows and movies this month[^1], and very much would like to share 'em all with you. So, without further ado...

## WHAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO

It'd be a long, long list if I were to type out every sonic novelty that's held my interest over the past three months, but here's a short list of records I've had blasting on [mocp](https://github.com/jonsafari/mocp) over the past bit, sorted by the two main places I listen to records--during my workouts, and in the studio.

(I'll be skipping doing Recommended Tracks for the "Workout Jamz" section, primarily because I was listening to each record/mix the whole way through while pumping iron or doing cardio and I didn't have much time to pick out individual tracks for you to check out. Still recommend you check out each record in their entirety, though, regardless of which list they're on.)

## WHAT'S NEXT

I expect to be doing a LOT of reading over the next few months, although it's not the kind of reading I'm going to be doing for pleasure. "Snakes" is proving to be far more of an undertaking than I'd imagine, and I'm going to have a shelf stacked full of case law, queer history, and current events articles for me to slog through. 

I do, however, also expect to have a few more movies and teevee shows to gripe about, seeing as I just loaded my Android device back up with more big dumb action movies. So look forward to that.

That's all I got for now. I'm jumping right from penning this to quickly hammering out this month's Jazz Program and Talkie Time schedule, so you should be able to peep that right after you peep this as they'll probably find themselves out on the same day. I've also got a new column that I hope you folks will enjoy hitting this site soon, so stay tuned for that as well. 

Regardless, thanks as always for reading. You're all amazing and don't let anyone tell you that you're not. Talk soon.

...Oh, and before I forget: fuck The Adjudicator. Lame-ass character.

*Footnotes...*

[^1]: One of the perks of being in the gym five out of seven days of the week to manage my ADHD is that I have a weird amount of time to camp on the treadmill and watch movies, as well as listen to new stuff either for The Jazz Program or for myself. See also the section on "Workout Jamz".   

[^2]: I genuinely don't know how, but we've had snow in April here. This place sucks.   

[^3]: I still have to use the men's locker room--being naturally bald kind of prevents me from even remotely passing enough to change in the women's, and there isn't a gender neutral option. Even if that wasn't the case, this is just kind of reality for most trans/gay folk, unfortunately. A lot of the survival skills I learned when I was openly gay in the Missourian backwoods still have to be applied over a decade later in a relatively blue city. Some things never change, unfortunately.  

[^4]: Top spot will always to to [whatever the hell Corey Hart was on about here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2LTL8KgKv8) I have to imagine the brainstorming session for this consisted of A&R asking our boy Corey if he had any ideas, and the man responding by snorting a line of cocaine off his television, pushing over a stack of straight-to-VHS pulp releases from the era, and screaming "ALL OF IT" at the top of his lungs.   

[^5]: If you're curious, my preferred "get into work mode" comfort playlist is Interpol's LP discography in chronological order, with "Antics" and "Turn On The Bright Lights" switched. When I used to drive semis, 'Next Exit' (track one on "Antics") was my alarm clock, and I'd spend my first few hours listening through their discography (with TOTBL following Antics, because how are you gonna skip TOTBL) while getting the engine warmed up and my brain woken up. I'll also occasionally put on listen to Cake's discography in chronological order for the same reasons, especially if I'm doing some writing instead of drawing that day.  

[^6]: I find most of my "jesus fuck this is fantastic I gotta find this album" tracks on either [KUVO](https://www.kuvo.org/), [KDHX](https://kdhx.org/), and (of course) [Soma.fm](https:/soma.fm)  

[^7]: And if you're wondering "is the big bad something gender/queerness related?"...I'm not watchin' the fuckin' thing, but [according to IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751129/), probably, yeah. Hell, Googling the name of the episode gives the description "A series of sexually-oriented murders that are identical, except that the killer appears to be both male and female, draws Scully and Mulder to an Amish-type community of people who may be alien in origin", which is somehow *worse* of a descriptor than IMDB gave. I'm good, bruh.

[^8]: If you're curious as to which of the listed movie selections were me starting shit with her and which was Autumn starting shit with me...Punisher Warzone was her pick, and The Rock was mine. Although, in fairness (as I kinda go into in the section about it) I was told The Rock would at least be interesting. So yeah, that's my bad.  

[^9]: This one's probably a bit inside-baseball for the cis sections of my audience, but the scene where [Loony Bin Jim shatters every single mirror so that Jigsaw never has to look at his reflection again](https://youtu.be/cCbgjrb75fg?t=209) borderline *screams* T4T romance to me in how it shows one person caring for another by doing their best to mitigate dysphoria through any means necessary, including by physically destroying mirrors with their own body. Although the tiiiny little detail where they're, you know, *blood relation brothers* makes that a bit weird...

[^10]: First is [Assassins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112401/), second is [Blade Runner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/). In the current runnings, at least. As with everything else, this list is subject to change.

[^11]: It's for this reason that Alec Baldwin will always be The Man to play Jack Ryan as far as I'm concerned. His portrayal in The Hunt For Red October hits exactly the parts of Ryan's character that nail him down as a relatable protagonist before the later books spiral out of control and have him stumbling upwards to the Presidency through some capital-letter Utter Bullshit Writing in ["Debt of Honor"](https://jackryan.fandom.com/wiki/Debt_of_Honor). See also the attached screenshot above if you think I'm fuckin' with you.
