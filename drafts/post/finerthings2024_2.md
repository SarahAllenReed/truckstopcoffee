description: "Third in a series of rambling reviews about records I've listened to, games I've played, books and movies I've enjoyed, and pipe tobaccos I've smoked. Yeah, yeah, I know the last one was in, like, May. It's been a weird fuckin' year, man. Buckle in; we've got a lot of ground to cover."

  <p> ah yes, the Owl Method of blogging: 1. write a couple of entries covering a couple months. 2. write about the rest of your fucking year </p>

---> Hell, we're skipping an entire month here cuz I don't even remember what I did in March at this point.

With that stated, I have listened to a whole lot of new records and watched a bunch of new shows and movies this month[^1], and very much would like to share 'em all with you. So, without further ado...

## WHAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO

We're well past the point where I'm going to be able to competently remember the vast majority of what I listened to for the latter three-quarters of the year. Thankfully, I serendipitously have at least *something* I can use here.

A good minute back, I started cataloging "shit i listened to in the studio" over on Mastodon and then on the [Listening List](/post/mist_listen). So, starting in around August of last year, I have a decent catalogue of stuff I've actually tuned into. This right here, then, will be a little jaunt through some of the ones I found more interesting.

## WHAT'S NEXT

I expect to be doing a LOT of reading over the next few months, although it's not the kind of reading I'm going to be doing for pleasure. "Snakes" is proving to be far more of an undertaking than I'd imagine, and I'm going to have a shelf stacked full of case law, queer history, and current events articles for me to slog through. 

I do, however, also expect to have a few more movies and teevee shows to gripe about, seeing as I just loaded my Android device back up with more big dumb action movies. So look forward to that.

That's all I got for now. I'm jumping right from penning this to quickly hammering out this month's Jazz Program and Talkie Time schedule, so you should be able to peep that right after you peep this as they'll probably find themselves out on the same day. I've also got a new column that I hope you folks will enjoy hitting this site soon, so stay tuned for that as well. 

Regardless, thanks as always for reading. You're all amazing and don't let anyone tell you that you're not. Talk soon.

*Footnotes...*

[^1]: 

[^ADD-SMOKE]: When I say "for the most part" I mean at some point during the move I found a multiple-year old jar of what I think is "Smoker's Choice" bourbon pipe tobacco. For the uninitiated, willingly buying "Smoker's Choice" is basically the equivalent to willingly purchasing Keystone Ice (which I also have been known to do in my more miserable and destitute seasons)--it'll get the job done, sure, but you are not going to be happy about it. Add two years of being stuck in a jar with no humidity...yeah. I've been trying to hit that shit as little as humanly possible.
