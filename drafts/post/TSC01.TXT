## PARLOR TRICKS

Believe it or not, the entirety of this article was typed on
a Smith-Corona PWP 3850 DS, and then subsequently brought
into Linux, edited with Vim, rendered to HTML with Hugo, and
delivered via an Apache web server directly to your computer 
screen.   

If you think I'm full of shit, go ahead--look to the right 
of this paragraph and check out the photo. There she is, 
the introduction you're reading right now, brought to you in
beautiful amber phosphorous.

If it seems a bit archaic to do things this way....yeah,
you're probably right. Thing is, I love stuff like this, and
despite the fact that not even most retro tech enthusiasts
give devices like this a second glance, word processors from
this era are infiniately fascinating to me, and I don't think
they get enough appreciation for their role in computing
history. 

I also happen to collect these things and use them for work,
belive it or not--word processors like this, along with my
arsenal of typewriters, are how i generate a good deal of the
text in the comics I create and stories I tell for a living.
I either use handwritten or typewritten text in all my
books, and as you'll soon see, these vintage word processors
have a typewriter hidden inside of them.

So, without further ado, here's a gigantic write-up
on how this works, what it is, why it works, and how I got
it to work, because I love my misfit toys and I wanna write
about my newest addition to the gang.
