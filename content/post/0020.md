  <p>pictured: your face when you realize exactly how incredible the programming is on tuesday nights on datafruits dot eff emm</p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of December of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>&quot;This Whole Thing Smacks Of Gender,&quot; i holler as i overturn the christmas tree and turn the December Programming List into the List Of S.H.I.T.</a></p>
</div>

We aren't playing any Christmas music this month on The Jazz Program--the concept of Christmas records as a whole are something i abhor to the point that i have virtually none in my collection at all--but we DO have a very special *ahem* corporate mandate from the all-powerful shrimpy deities over at [Shrimp Shake Co](https://youtu.be/ckaBRAJLock). that we *have* to do at least *something* goofy for The Holiday Season.

In fact, we have an entire list worth of mandates. An entire datatable worth of seasonal happenings that we have to divvy out in installments, lest we get our incredibly lucrative Internet radio paychecks in the form of Spicy Shrimp Shakes poured into a goo bomb and dumped in our mailbox again. It's called the Seasonal Happenings Installments Table, and we're taking one entry off of it every week this month and filling your radio with some holiday S.H.I.T.

...look man, you can complain if you want, but I'm still cleaning the habanero sauce and radioactive shrimp waste from last year's "Christmas performance bonus" out of the cracks in the mail room door, and I reeeally don't wanna do that again.

So, what's on the S.H.I.T. list this year? What are we playing on The Jazz Program if we're not blasting Mariah Carey like literally everyone else? Why doesn't that cute bear of a mall Santa return my calls? Some of your answers lie below....so read on, and let's get into it.

### Talkie Time Presents The Holiday S.H.I.T. List : Rocky Fortune - The Plot To Murder Santa Claus / Pint Sized Payroll Bandit

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0020/02.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0020/02.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>"it's christmas, see. now you listen up, you're playing christmasy things and you're playin' 'em now, see, or i'll sick sammy davis jr. on ya, see"--frank sinatra, probably</a></p>
</div>

Rocko Fortunato's back on the program again, and this time he's got the first in our four "crimes involving Santa Claus because it's December and we've got to at least pretend we care about being seasonally appropriate" episodes. 

Look, man, if it was good enough for every single radio and television program since forever, it's good enough for us. 

We'll be showcasing one Christmas episode of some various crime drama program off of our Seasonal Happenings Installments Table every week this month, and once we're done with that S.H.I.T. I'll just pick one of the funnier named or more ridiculous episodes of each program to balance things out for us Grinches. Kosher? Kosher.

This week, our holiday S.H.I.T is "The Plot To Murder Santa Claus", released on December 22, 1953. We'll be washing it down right after with "Pint Size Payroll Bandit", which originally aired on November 3, 1953, and which tells the story of a nine-year-old making off with an entire cash register's worth of dough. In a way, this is seasonally appropriate too--just imagine how many PS5s you could nab with fifty grand in 1953 money.

### The Jazz Program Presents Mister Pliskin's Picks (Record Store Pickups, December 2023) - Jean-Luc Ponty's "Enigmatic Ocean" / Makoto Ozone's "Ozone" / Schönherz And Scott's "One Night In Vienna"

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/01.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/15.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>he is Very Large, you understand (click to see a me for scale)</a></p>
</div>

If you missed it, over on [Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/111518161203472949) I recently ran through (with the help of Mister Pliskin The Very Large Teddy Bear, of course) some recent acquisitions I made while at the local record shop. ([You can also check out the photo roll right here on the site if you'd prefer to do that.](/post/photoroll12))

Thing is, we haven't had much in the way of listener requests for our usual first-of-the-month Listener Request Night for a good couple months, and I need excuses to get out of the house more often.

So, with the help of Mister Plisken here, we'll be starting a new theme night for these first-of-the-month shows: Mister Pliskin's Picks. I'll head to the local record store (or a not-a-local one, if I happen to be on the road at any point during that month) and grab some jazz and jazz-adjacent records. Then I'll pick three of 'em, find digital copies of 'em, and play them on the air.

For this first installment, we've got Jean-Luc Ponty's 1977 release "Enigmatic Ocean", followed by Makoto Ozone's utterly fantastic 1984 release "Ozone" and closing it out with my beloved Windham Hill Records' 1987 release of Schönherz And Scott's "One Night In Vienna". 

I still plan on doing listener request nights here and there, but since we haven't had one in a few months now I'm going to drop it back down to an occasional feature. As always, if you have a request for an episode of The Jazz Program, feel free to [email me](mailto=sarah@sarahallenreed.com) and I'll put your request on the air on a future episode of The Jazz Program!

### Talkie Time Presents The Holiday S.H.I.T. List : Jeff Regan, Investigator - Five Hundred Santas From Mexico / A Streetcar Named Schultz

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0020/03.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0020/03.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>If the name Jack Webb sounds familiar, it should; he went on to be the voice of none other than Friday from Dragnet, which we'll be playing next week.</a></p>
</div>

We're back with the second installment off this year's picks from the Seasonal Happenings Installment Table, and if you couldn't tell from the title of this episode, you're in for some crazy S.H.I.T. 

Jeff Regan was one of Jack Webb's first roles in its originaly 1948 run, and eventually got a revival that saw Regan voiced by Frank Graham and Paul Dubov. Our boy Jeff had himself a pretty typical gig as far as radio crime detectives are concerned--he got himself the nickname of "The Lyon's Eye", made about ten a day, and solved crimes. 

Today, however, he's dealing with something a bit less typical, as well as a whoooole lot of department store Santas. Ten a day just isn't enough some days.

We'll be listening to "Five Hundred Santas From Mexico" (originally aired November 11, 1949), and once we've excized that from our weekly quota of holiday S.H.I.T. we'll be playing some more Jeff Regan with "A Streetcar Named Schultz" (originally aired January 10, 1950).

  <p>The first Moe Koffman record I ever owned, and so far the only one I own on vinyl--The Shepherd Swings Again, from 1957. Click the image to see this record in the flesh.</a></p>
</div>

### The Jazz Program: Moe Koffman - Moe's Curried Soul (1970) / Goes Electric (1967) / The Shepherd Swings Again (1957)

Moe Koffman is easily one of my favorite flautists in all of music--and that's saying something, given how big of a Jethro Tull fan I am. (Don't worry, no one's dethroning my boy Ian.) 

Playing with such big swingin' names as Rob McConnell, Johnny Burt, and Howard Cable, it should be no surprise that when Moe got his own act some of the first things he did were swing records, including "The Shepherd Swings Again", released in 1957. 

Moe wasn't a one-trick pony by any stretch of the definition, though, and in this episode of The Jazz Program we'll be taking a look at two more of the many styles The Shepherd had in his repertoire. 

From some soul-jazz on 1970's "Moe's Curried Soul", to some '60s psych-rock-adjacent noodling on 1968's "Goes Electric", Moe could do it all, and we'll be going through it all tonight. Hope you can join us.

### Talkie Time Presents The Holiday S.H.I.T. List : Dragnet - Twenty-Two Rifle For Christmas / The Big Little Jesus

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0020/05_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0020/05_2large.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>"the only thing i ever give anyone for christmas is a FAT PACK OF L&M REDS. in fact, that's all i ever give anyone. i just stand by the corner by the First Presbyterian dressed as santa claus and chuck them at children. i'm banned from every single church potluck and they won't let me see my son anymore" --mister dragnet mans</a></p>
</div>

We had "We Had Jack Webb At Home" last week, and now to avoid all you children kicking the back of my seat and screaming about how you wanna go to Actual Jack Webb and not Jack Regan because Jack Regan tastes funny....we've got Actual Jack Webb this week. Please stop throwing your crayons at me. I am trying to drive.

Next up on the S.H.I.T. list is everyone's favorite police procedural (or at least the one everyone actually knows), the legendary Dragnet. Joe Friday and the boys drive around, solve crimes, and change the names of the people involved in them to protect the innocent. 

We got a two-for-one Christmas special for ya today. Originally broadcast on December 21, 1952, our first pick "Twenty-Two Rifle For Christmas" is exactly what it says on the tin. Does anyone [get their eye shot out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrAwb9ptu9U)? 

...well, I'd say you have to tune in to find out, but considering this was one of the more infamous episodes of Dragnet for being one of the many times the writers pushed the envelope of what was acceptable at the time by having *outright child death* in the script....yeah, yeah they do. Nice work, Friday. 10/10 police work.

After that, we've got yet another Christmas story courtesy of the S.H.I.T. list--"The Big Little Jesus", which was originally broadcast two years later on December 21, 1954. Someone took the local Mission's Jesus statue, and our boy Friday's gotta go get it back--but not before griping about marriage and holiday cards or something, because you just aren't a hard-boiled crime-solving mans if you don't have seventy million reasons why you don't get involved with trivial things like "christmas cards" or "marriage" or "family" or "basic pleasantries".

Look, given the events of "Twenty-Two Rifle For Christmas", I'm all for keeping Friday away from *anything* that might lead to him having children.  

### The Jazz Program: Gil Goldstein And Friends - Infinite Love (with Romero Lubambo) (1993) / Brooklyn Sessions (with Jorge Pardo) (2020) / Longing (with Bob Mintzer) (2007)

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0020/05.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0020/05.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>The great Gil Goldstein, <a href="https://chiaroscurojazz.org/artists/gil-goldstein/">as he appears on the website of the fantastic Chiaroscuro Jazz Records</a> homepage. I've been listening to <a href="https://chiaroscurojazz.org/radio/">their station</a> a LOT lately, and you can thank them playing <a href="https://sunny.garden/@sarahallenreed/111603465834018187">'Boy Inside A Drum'</a> for inspiring tonight's programming.</p>
</div>

The music of Gil Goldstein needs no introduction, but like most jazz cats who made their living as session musicians Gil himself just might. Thankfully for you, we've got three records of his for you to give you a bit of a primer on this accordion virtuoso.

We can't cover every fantastic record he's played on in one evening, sadly--although [I would highly recommend this article over on Jazzwax if you'd like an even more extensive primer](https://www.jazzwax.com/2020/07/gil-goldstein-in-10-albums.html), featuring ten selections by Gil himself--but we've got three of them that should give you a good introduction.

First off, we've got the 1993 Big World Music release "Infinite Love", with Gil on piano and accordion and the fantastic contemporary Brazillian jazz virtuoso Romero Lubambo on guitar. Mixing bossa with modern smooth jazz influence, Gil and Romero start us off a smooth, smooth cocktail of latin-tinged color.

After that, we head to Brooklyn with the 2020 release--decidedly more recent than most of the stuff we play on the program!--"Brooklyn Sessions". Featuring the stripped-down lineup of legendary Brazillian flautist & saxophonist Jorge Pardo Cordero, Gil himself on piano, and not too much else, this one is a fantastically intimate listen that showcases Gil's mastery of accompaniment.

Finally, we're heading back to the 90's, with 1997's "Longing". Saxophonist Bob Mintzer takes point on this one, with our boy Gil floating his piano chords just below Mintzer's cool, gentle waves. 

All three albums are fantastic and go down smooth as butter. Hope you can join us.

## December 25, 2023, CHRISTMAS DAY - JAZZY FUCKIN' HOLIDAYS, PART 2


<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/011/c8.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/000/03.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>The poster for this year's incarnation of the Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays Charity Marathon. <a href="/post/photoroll11/">Go check out the process thread here</a>, or click the image itself to see the 2021 poster.</p>
</div>

It's the holiday season yet again, which means it's time for yet another installment of Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays. 

If you aren't familiar, every year on Thanksgiving and Christmas I do a twenty-four-hour long charity drive marathon for queer charities. I think this is our third(?) year running--Tony or Oven would remember better than I. Regardless, I've been doing these marathons every year for a while, doing my best to help those who--like me--don't have anywhere to go on the holidays feel a bit less alone.

Come tune in, as we keep you company through the holidays, spin jazz records to stave off the quiet, and help raise money for organizations that give an ear to those who might be having a difficult time during the holidays. We've got an active chat, and I'll be live on the microphones from when I wake up to when I pass out as well, doing station bumps as often as I can and spinning tunes to keep you company.

And hey, even if you have somewhere to be, feel free to toss us on the air during your family gatherings! The playlist covers nearly every part of the smoother playlists you can usually find here on The Jazz Program, with quite a bit more smooth, post-bop, and vocal jazz and no free-jazz or avant-garde bumps. 

Plus, the playlist does not contain a *single* instance of a Christmas song at all--and yes, for my retail friends, *that does in fact include "All I Want For Christmas Is You."*. Not a single bit of Mariah Carrey or [Musak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak) christmas bullshit in the bunch.

Poster's free and it's printable, by the way. Drawn by yours truly. 300dpi, prints at 11x17. Print off a bunch and put 'em up all over town--and if you do, take a picture and tag me. [Download a .PDF of it here.](/stuff/jfc2023.pdf)

Look forward to seeing you there.

### Talkie Time Presents The Holiday S.H.I.T. List : Casey, Crime Photographer - Santa Claus Of Bum Boulevard / The Snowball

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0020/06.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0020/06.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>"I'M WITH THE SHRIMP SHAKE CORPORATION, NOW YOU'RE GONNA PLAY THIS LIST OF CHRISTMAS SHOWS OR YOU'RE GONNA GET IT" --definitely not this guy, probably</a></p>
</div>

This is the second month in a row we've played our boy Casey, and given how much I love our boy Casey's adventures you sure would figure that at some point I would bother giving him his own episode instead of playing him [during meme shows](https://truckstop.coffee/post/0019/#november-7-2023----dice-roll-night). Unfortunately, we've got one more night worth of meme shows, and Casey's got himself a double feature.

The final entry in our List Of S.H.I.T. is The Santa Claus Of Bum Boulevard, originally broadcast on December 25, 2027. Santa gets his ass robbed, and Casey's the only one who can get the money back. I don't know why you'd trust a down-on-his-luck-photojournalist to *return* a fat wad of cash, but then again I don't know why I'm letting Shrimp Shake Co. make me play a bunch of Christmas programming either. Sometimes life is full of mysteries, and sometimes those mysteries smell like blackmail. 

Now, I'm not saying that this episode of Casey, Crime Photographer *contains* any blackmail, but I *am* saying that these episodes are sponsored by Shrimp Shake Co who I am legally obligated to tell you do *not* have a man in a shrimp mascot costume outside of my window right now. 

Next up, it's "The Snowball", originally aired on August 25, 1949. I'm gonna be honest here--this one has really nothing to do with Christmas or snow whatsoever. I just picked it because it sounds Christmas-y enough to close out the month and I'd like the guy in the shrimp suit who is "definitely not" still outside of the window to leave.

### The Jazz Program Presents CRIME JAZZ NIGHT! --Volume 1, Disc 11 : Roy Budd In Action!

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don’t know, we’ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night.

We’ll be spinning the eleventh release in Volume 1, featuring two disks worth of the fantastic compositional work of the late great Roy Budd, who you may know from the soundtracks of such fantastic films as "The Marseille Contract", "Get Carter", and "Tomorrow Never Comes". If you like bombastic '70s movies and you like your jazz flavored with a bit of crime and noir, you won't wanna miss this.

Hope you can join us.

That's about it for this episode! Thanks again for reading, and thank you for sticking with me for yet another year's worth of DJing on datafruits.fm. You're all wonderful, and I hope to see you all in the chat in the new year as well! 

I don't have much planned yet for 2024's programming calendar, so if you have any suggestions, [email me](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) and let me know what you want to hear in the new year!

Stay safe, and I'll see you all soon.

Footnotes...

...hey, you know what, there's actually no footnotes this time. Clearly, a herculean display of mental fortitude on my part. Someone should be proud of me or give me a medal or something.

nah don't worry i'll have a lot more for you next year lol
