  <p>IN A NOT TOO DISTANT HOLIDAY, NEXT THURSDAY AD!</a></p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of December of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

Oh, and before we start in--quick thanks to [Leah Rowe and 1337box](https://vimuser.org/1337box.html) for a fun new tool for visual gags. I shy away from using Javascript on this website (and in most things, to be honest), which meant that every image you clicked up until this point has just either loaded the full-size image and disrupted the flow of the article or led to an external source. The original [Lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) was pretty damn heavy on JS and pretty damn unoptimized as well, which kept me from doing too much with it. 

Thankfully, though, Leah's implementation lets me not only have Lightbox functionality here (click that old MST3K newspaper advert up there to see it in action!) but also lets me play some cool tricks. [You can check out a more thorough demo of it on their site](https://vimuser.org/demo.1337box_default.html), but hopefully my first little outing with it on a full article here shows you all the fun stuff you can do with this Creative Commons-licensed tool.

I'll be backporting this all into previous articles hopefully before the end of the year, but in the meantime, click away on the images here! You might find something fun.

### Talkie Time: Rocky Fortune - The Plot To Murder Santa Claus / Pint Sized Payroll Bandit

  <p>"it's christmas, see. now you listen up, you're playing christmasy things and you're playin' 'em now, see, or i'll sick sammy davis jr. on ya, see"--frank sinatra, probably</a></p>
</div>

Rocko Fortunato's back on the program again, and this time he's got the first in our four "crimes involving Santa Claus because it's December and we've got to at least pretend we care about being seasonally appropriate" episodes. 

Look, man, if it was good enough for every single radio and television program since forever, it's good enough for us. 

We'll be showcasing one Christmas episode of some various crime drama program off of our Seasonal Happenings Installments Table every week this month, and once we're done with that S.H.I.T. I'll just pick one of the funnier named or more ridiculous episodes of each program to balance things out for us Grinches. Kosher? Kosher.

This week, our holiday S.H.I.T is "The Plot To Murder Santa Claus", released on December 22, 1953. We'll be washing it down right after with "Pint Size Payroll Bandit", which originally aired on November 3, 1953, and which tells the story of a nine-year-old making off with an entire cash register's worth of dough. In a way, this is seasonally appropriate too--just imagine how many PS5s you could nab with fifty grand in 1953 money.

### The Jazz Program Presents Mister Pliskin's Picks (Record Store Pickups, December 2023) - Jean-Luc Ponty's "Enigmatic Ocean" / Makoto Ozone's "Ozone" / Schönherz And Scott's "One Night In Vienna"

  <p>he is Very Large, you understand (click to see a me for scale)</a></p>
</div>

If you missed it, over on [Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/111518161203472949) I recently ran through (with the help of Mister Pliskin The Very Large Teddy Bear, of course) some recent acquisitions I made while at the local record shop. ([You can also check out the photo roll right here on the site if you'd prefer to do that.](/post/photoroll12))

Thing is, we haven't had much in the way of listener requests for our usual first-of-the-month Listener Request Night for a good couple months, and I need excuses to get out of the house more often.

So, with the help of Mister Plisken here, we'll be starting a new theme night for these first-of-the-month shows: Mister Pliskin's Picks. I'll head to the local record store (or a not-a-local one, if I happen to be on the road at any point during that month) and grab some jazz and jazz-adjacent records. Then I'll pick three of 'em, find digital copies of 'em, and play them on the air.

For this first installment, we've got Jean-Luc Ponty's 1977 release "Enigmatic Ocean", followed by Makoto Ozone's utterly fantastic 1984 release "Ozone" and closing it out with my beloved Windham Hill Records' 1987 release of Schönherz And Scott's "One Night In Vienna". 

I still plan on doing listener request nights here and there, but since we haven't had one in a few months now I'm going to drop it back down to an occasional feature. As always, if you have a request for an episode of The Jazz Program, feel free to [email me](mailto=sarah@sarahallenreed.com) and I'll put your request on the air on a future episode of The Jazz Program!

Footnotes...

[^1]: At the risk of spoiling the magic here, I just kind of picked a few from my folders at random before we went live. I don't have D100s here and I do have a massive record collection, so whenever we do this theme night again (which will prolly happen, as I sometimes am not the best at planning things) you'll have to pretend that there's actual dice rolls happening. I did borrow a bunch of Autumn's polyhedral dice, tho, and my radio desk is pretty noisy if you chuck stuff at it. So  we did have foley tools available to at least give the fun lil' illusion.

[^2]: I actually did a bit more research on this one, and as best I can tell it [seems to be a bootleg collection](https://musicbrainz.org/release/c35c5e04-9b7c-4f84-9e7d-fc8bd18b45e8). The only entry I can find of it, however, is on MusicBrainz, which...isn't usually something I use as a reliable research source, to say the least. <br/><br/>The fact that it *is* only on there, however, does kind of underscore that this is probably a bootleg--Musicbrainz primarily relies on user-submitted entries and doesn't require as much proof or have as much back-checking or (the important part!) insistence upon physical or label-verified releases as Discogs does, which lends credibility to this being an Internet-only bootleg compilation that ended up in enough people's collections to end up having its own ID3 tag submitted to MB.

[^3]: ...Okay, I debated putting this in-line, but it took up the whole textbox, so you're getting it here. <br/><br/><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/05deetsm.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/05deet.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span>
<br/> I had a helluva time trying to figure out what in God's name this pipe is. Damn thing looks like the artist tried making a straight-pipe version of a <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier">cavalier</a>, some very anglo-American variant/appropriation of a [Čhaŋnúŋpa](https://spiritualitycircle.com/display-only/sacred-pipe), or a [midwakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwakh) with an extended bowl (although that one specifically is fairly unlikely) but it just looks like something you'd pick up at a head shop, especially with that white stem there that almost looks like straight up glass. <br/><br/>I actually went on a small research tangent while writing this (because of course I did) to try and see if Howard Duff had any photos of him smoking this monstrosity that the artist might have used as a reference, but the only photos I could find of him with a pipe were a standard [straight billiard](https://pipedia.org/wiki/Billiard) or [Dublin](https://pipedia.org/wiki/Dublin). I almost gave up after hours of work...until, much to my annoyance, Autumn took one look at the advert and pointed out that the pipe had a brand name on the stem. "Dana."<br/><br/> Look man, sometimes my reading comprehension ain't that great. <br/><br/>So no, it's not a crack pipe, despite reeeally looking like one. It's a [DANA 31](https://pipedia.org/wiki/DANA_31), which apparently had quite a few [advertisements](https://pipedia.org/wiki/File:Dana_31.jpg) that paired it with a deal with Edgeworth tobacco, and [had other big names like composer David Rose](https://pipedia.org/wiki/File:Dana_31_dgeworth.JPG) backing it up.<br/><br/>I still think it looks like a god damned crack pipe, though. With that stated, Autumn cracked a joke about how &quot;it looks like it should come standard with an [FP-45 Liberator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP-45_Liberator) in your [OSS-issued nazi killing care package](https://ourladymaven.com)&quot;, and to be honest that reeeally makes me wanna track one or two down for my collection.

[^4]: If you're curious--no, I don't usually stay up for the full 24. From when I go to sleep (usually around 0100) to when I wake up (around 0900/1000), I use [Mixxx's AutoDJ function](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html#auto-dj) to keep the joint bumping. We'll still be taking donations for the charities and all that when I'm asleep, regardless, and if you need a friendly voice you'll more than likely find one in the Datafruits chat. So, if you happen to wake up earlier than I do, don't fret--we'll keep the jazz going for you, friend.
