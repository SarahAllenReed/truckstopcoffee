For whatever reason, a lot of folks seem to be fascinated with knowing what folks who create things look like. I've never understood it--partially because I'm not exactly the type of artist known for going out of her way to look remotely presentable--but for those of you curious, here's a tiny little selection of self-portraits and press photos I've had taken over the years.

![A self-portrait of the artist, drawn around 2017 or so, depicting her sitting at a very crowded office desk, surrounded by computers and papers.](/photo/000/01.png)

Self-portrait from the pages of Tabula Rosetta. Drawn in...2018, I think? Might have been late 2017.

One example of my yearly tradition of in-joke self-portraits. This one's got me ripping on [Matt Adrian's Troubled Birds.](https://www.mincingmockingbird.com/products/fatal-american-need-postcards-set-of-12-troubled-birds)

Another in-joke yearly selfie. This one's ripping on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">Ren√© Magritte's "The Treachary Of Images". 2021.

Another dumb in-joke selfie, this time last year's. This one's me as <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gentlemen">Spy from TF2 in the old "Gentlemen" meme.</a> 2022's entry into the series.

A small shutter-timer selfie taken in mid-2022. One of the only decent photos of me in recent memory, and the second-to-last public-facing photo taken of me in 2022.

The most recent photo taken of me, mainly as a test to get Imogen (my Nikon here) on camera. And yes, you saw that time gap correctly--this is more or less the only photo I took of myself in over a year. I wasn't joking in <a href="/post/faq/#what-do-you-look-like">my FAQ.</a> Fall 2023.
