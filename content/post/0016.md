## WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO

### SOCIAL MEDIA SUCKAGE

So, as you all know, the Long Stinky Man has taken everyone's least favorite hellsite on a mission to find a place deeper than hell to piledrive it into. Us professional illustrator types have been particularly screwed by this--Twitter was, for most of us, a professional [zugzwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang) we all were trapped in and had to use to try and find jobs, gigs, and commissions on top of the usual metagame of trying to avoid being that day's [Main Character](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character) and getting called fun slurs by Nazis if we just so happened to be anything other than white cis dudes.

As most of you know, I haven't had an account on there since, like, last October. So where am I at now?

I currently have a few social media accounts I've been using to cover the bases, but the one I'm most focused on actually using is Mastodon. You can find me over on [defcon.social](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed) for now (if that changes, I'll do my best to come back and edit this article to reflect that), and while I still am on Instagram [despite them damn near banning me for no reason](/post/0005/) I have also moved over to Pixelfed, and [you can find me over there as well.](https://pixelfed.social/@sarahallenreed)

I have a few other accounts as well,[^5], but to be frank I have next to no desire to promote my presence on non-free sites I do not directly manage anymore. FLOSS social media protocols are one thing, and if you want updates you can get 'em here or on [the main site](https://sarahallenreed.com), but corpo-owned tripe ain't my bag anymore. If you find me on 'em, though, I sure hope they lead you here.

I also genuinely hope more cartoonists, illustrators, and creatives roll their own websites and blogs again. The web's going to keep going to hell if we leave it in the hands of these corpo bougie fucks. We can take it back, though; and damnit, we should.  

### ON THE ROAD AGAIN (FOR A BRIEF MINUTE)

Now for the best news of all: we finally escaped from Denver. Ended up back on the banks of the rivers I was born next to, albeit a few hundred miles north of my original spawn point. [^4] Most of the past month has been Autumn, Polyhymnia and I finally settling in as best we can, trying to find day jobs to build our cash stacks back, and hopefully making a place for both of us to create, make art, and hopefully keep working on games and comix together in.
 
The trip took us eight hundred and fifty miles from Denver to the Quad Cities, and was a lovely (if stressful) trip. I honestly forgot how much I missed the road, and now that we're here my main goal is to hopefully save up and get myself a new ship. I've no idea if the Diogenes' Barrel Mk. 4 will be a full-on RV or just a van with a campin' stove and a cot in it, but once I get the cash, I'll be grabbing the keys and then I'll probably be back to wanderin' and--hopefully--back on tour.

While we're on the subject of touring...it should be mentioned that, yes, we also aren't that far from the underground comix mecca that is Chicago, but I don't plan on making much of that right now, especially in terms of going to cons or meetups. Over the past few years (and especially in the past few months), I've had to re-learn one of the more unpleasant lessons I always seem to forget: I am not particularly good at making friends, *especially* with other artists. Who I am on the page and on the mic is a mite bit different from who I am unfiltered in real life, unfortunately; the buffer of the page and the confidence of the brush kind of do wonders to shield audiences from the fact that--like most cartoonists--I'm not exactly what you would call "fun at parties", and--unlike most of my peers--I'm also the opposite of what one would call "fluffy, artsy, soft, and approachable". Add into that the isolation of the past few years, combine it with the whammy of getting sober and removing [Dutch courage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_courage) from my toolkit, and yeah, I'm up a creek without a paddle when it comes to navigating the fun waters of socialization. The few times I've tried to reach out to find community with others since getting sober have very much seen me floundering at best and fuarrking everything up at worst. No, I'd rather spend the winter trying to figure out how to *not* keep doing that before I have to stumble my autistic ass into a con and pretend to be people.

So yeah, I may see about driving up to catch a jazz show or playing a set with the Datafruits kids up in Chicago, and you may be able to catch me at an open mic trying to get my voice back if you come visit the Quad Cities, but as for right now I'd rather focus on building my studio back and getting my head back together. No cons or tour for me right now.

Speaking of which...

### GETTING MY SHIT TOGETHER

Finally, if I have one goal for the rest of the year outside of contractual obligations, it's to get my head back on straight and the rest of BLACKWORK's affairs back in order.

It's been a bit of an open secret that the past couple years have been some of the worst in my (admittedly horrifyingly tough) life. I won't go into the exact sequence of events here (although [I did touch on one specific Bad Time here on this blog](/post/0009/)) but let me put it this way: in 2021, I got hit by a bus. That's not a bad joke. I mean *a literal bus*. My '85 Ford truck, which I was in the process of buying a trailer RV for, was totalled. The impact rocked my truck with enough force to push the V8 block clear through the steel frame. I lost my transportation, lost my means of transporting a trailer for me to live in and escape Colorado in, and damn near lost my day job on top of that.

Getting hit by that bus was the *fifth* most traumatic thing to happen in the past four years. 

Again, *getting hit by a bus--the type of car wreck that you literally use as a metaphor for an event that knocks your life out of whack, not to mention an event that nearly killed me--* ranks ***fifth.***

Needless to say, I've been a bit behind the ball for years now. I just don't want to *stay* that way. It's not fair to me, and it's not fair to all of you either.

First on the docket once I get the studio in order is clearing out the backlog. I have a few commissions I need to complete still for some of you fine folk, and I have a few packages of comix to send out from the web store from very, very long overdue orders. Once I manage to ship all of those, *I will be closing new commissions and closing the webstore for the forseeable future.* I want time to get my head back together, time to re-learn how to draw for myself, time to build back a lot of the things I lost over the past few years. Living with the double whammy of autism and ADHD with no access to medication or help of any kind is rough enough when you aren't going through year after year of getting whacked over the noggin with traumatic event after traumatic event, but I've had to play this hand long enough to know how to deal with it once things settle down[^6]. Hopefully, things *stay* settled down, and I can get this new incarnation of the studio back up to what it was.

That's about the long and short of it! Sorry for the absences 

Thank you all, as always, for reading. You're all amazing and don't let anyone tell you that you're not. See you soon.

Look, I just missed my rivers, alright? After four years stuck in the Rockies I'll take what I can get.

[^5]: [As I bitched about at length over on Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110962544357932869), I have actively been avoiding using Bsky, as it genuinely seems like a worse, more fucked up, and toxic version of Twitter , where everyone actually seems to be *trying* to be the main character. I have no desire to be the main character of anything, much less of Twitter: Thunderdome Edition, so I'm mainly just sitting on that account so no one else takes my username. I'll probably delete the thing in a few months.

[^6]: I also lift and [ruck](https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/what-is-a-ruck-great-question) multiple times a week, and smoke enough cigars and drink enough coffee to kill a horse. So that helps.
