Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of June of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

First, a bit of an interlude...

## FIRST YOU MUST AQUIRE A TASTE FOR...FREEFORM JAZZ! AND POP JAZZ, AND TRIP HOP, AND POST-BOP...

</div>

Last month, I talked a bit about how I track down the history of old-time radio for Talkie Time, as well as a bit more about my love of radio and where I find new music for The Jazz Program. This month, we're talking a bit about the Jazz Program; or, to be more specific, why the width and breadth of what I consider fair game for this program is as vast as it is.

As I've mentioned before, I was born in the greater Saint Louis area, and an unreasonable portion of my taste in music and styles as a DJ come from the radio dial around that region. One station I somehow haven't mentioned before now is KDHX, and if there is one FM or AM station most directly responsible for how eclectic my tastes can be, it's this one.

  <p> The man most responsible for getting me into reggae, KDHX's own DJ Ital K. </p>
</div>

KDHX is a legendary independent community radio station out of Saint Louis, and it operates on a "free-format" programming lineup, meaning that whatever you hear on the radio during any hour of the day could and often well be vastly different than what you'll hear in three or four hours or so. I remember spending a good amount of my late teens and early twenties soaking up some fine jazz from [Andy Coco on The Rhythm Section](https://kdhx.org/shows/show/rhythmsection)[^1] on Friday afternoons, and then staying up as late as I could to catch [DJ Iceman's Deep Krate Radio](https://kdhx.org/shows/show/deepkrateradio) and then [Ital-K's Ital Rhythms](https://kdhx.org/shows/show/italrhythms) later that evening. It's evenings like that--going from jazz standards, to hip-hop, to reggae in one single twelve-hour timespan--that cemented how I pick records now that I'm a DJ. 

While I don't have twelve-plus hours worth of time to spend with you all, I do like making sure that, when you can catch a show, you're catching something that's completely unlike the last one you tuned into. Variety is the spice of life after all, and part of why I love spinning records on the air is because I love sharing new things I've found with all of you. 

Speaking of...

## June 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule

### June 6, 2023 - NO PROGRAMMING TONIGHT

As you probably guessed given the date this was posted, I ended up up taking this evening off. I've been busy as all get out, and needed a bit of a break. 

On a side note...the first Tuesday of the month usually would be Listener Request Night on The Jazz Program, but I haven't had any listener requests in for the past month or so. [Got something you wanna hear? Send me some for next month!](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) 

### June 13, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : The Big Story - Murderous Kid (01.05.1949) / Three Coins Spell Death ( 12.14.1949)

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0012/02.jpg"><img src="/blog/0012/02.jpg" alt="Advertisement for The Big Story."></a></p>
  <p> FREE CIGARETTE MONEY AND COOL STORIES? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP </p>
</div>

I'm a cartoonist and writer by trade ([if you didn't know that for some reason](https://sarahallenreed.com)), and let me tell you right now--if I got five hundred bucks and some cigarettes for winning a "best journalistic work" competition, I'd be first in line to drive out to New York, bop some poor bastard one over the head, stuff him in a locker, take his press card, and head out to bust some scoops. 

Weirdly enough, that was actually a thing in the early 40s. Sponsored by Pall Mall in its early years and my beloved Lucky Strikes in its final two, and having the fascinating honor of besting Bing Crosby's "Philco Radio Time" in the ratings for a time during its first year, The Big Story sought out journos who "solved a crime, exposed a corrupt political administration, smashed a racket, or performed some other notable public service" and gave 'em five hundred bucks on the dime of one half of the preferred [Euorpean Breakfast](https://mikeshaheen1.medium.com/the-unholy-morning-union-of-black-coffee-and-a-cigarette-ff69181ac1f) enjoyed by writers the world over[^2]. If only [Wilkins Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhIizQQol0) did one for illustrators. I'd be all set.

We'll be listening to "Murderous Kid", originally aired in January of 1959, and "Three Coins Spell Death", which aired on December 14 of the same year.

  <p><a href= "/blog/0012/04.jpg"><img src="/blog/0012/04.jpg" alt="Cover art to Hideo Shiraki's &quot;In Fiesta&quot;."></a></p>
  <p> You can't deny how hard this cover art goes. </p>
</div>

#### The Jazz Program: Hideo Shiraki - Plays Horace Silver (1962) / Plays Bossa Nova (1962) / In Fiesta (1961)

The fantastic works of Japanese drummer Hideo Shiraki are an interesting introduction into the Japanese "funky boom" scene of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. While not in the slightest bit unfamiliar with his own native land's styles and instrumentation--1965 saw his quintet playing alongside a koto quartet at the Berlin Jazz Festival--Shiraki was at his best blasting rare grooves and providing the backbeat for (and leading role in) his legendary five-piece for a 1960s Japanese scene that craved a uniquely local take on the West's hard bop sound.

We'll be jamming the Hideo Shiraki Quintet's "Plays Horace Silver" from '62, "Hideo Shiraki Plays Bossa Nova" from the same year, and his fantastic "In Fiesta" from '61 to close out the album.

### June 20, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : 21st Precinct - The Nolen Brothers (07.07.1953) / Case Of The Young Incorrigible (07.14.1953)

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0012/05.jpg"><img src="/blog/0012/05.jpg" alt="Everett Sloane."></a></p>
  <p> The Captain himself. </p>
</div>

You don't get a more by-the-book police procedural than what the 21st Precinct has to offer. Starting from the opening phone call to emergency services and ending with the report, 21st Precinct stars Everett Sloane as New York's finest Captain Frank Kennelly (or at least it did for the first hundred or so episodes), who heads the police precinct that covers the humble nine-tenths of a square mile between Fifth Avenue and the East River. 

Only 92 episodes of the over 150 ever aired survived, and interestingly enough we seem to have one loving old time radio fan to thank, as nearly all of the ones which are still around were said to be recorded by one very dedicated collector as they were broadcast, according to the [OTRR.](https://otrr.org) We'll be taking a listen to some of the first episodes ever aired in the series, both aired in July of 1953--"The Nolen Brothers" aired on July 7, and "Case Of The Young Incorrigible", which aired the following week on July 14.

#### The Jazz Program: DJ Spooky - Celestial Mechanix: The Blue Series Mastermix (2004)

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0012/06.jpg"><img src="/blog/0012/06.jpg" alt="Cover art to DJ Spooky's &quot;Optometry&quot;."></a></p>
  <p> Another time, perhaps. </p>
</div>

Paul Miller, known to heads worldwide as DJ Spooky, is one of my favorite DJs of all time for an absurd amount of reasons, not least of which are his works released on strange jazz label Thirsty Ear. Of those records, one stands out for one reason in particular--it functions as a chopped, screwed, re-sampled, and re-purposed walkthrough of the *entirety* of Thirsty Ear's "Blue Series" set of releases up to this point in the timeline. "The Shape Of Jazz To Come", indeed. No other records, no distractions; I'll be ceding the entire show to this one two-hour masterwork, from start to finish.

Oh, and if you want to get more into DJ Spooky's other jazz-adjacent records...We aren't playing them tonight (although I do intend on revisiting the Subliminal Kid's work another time on this show) I genuinely recommend picking up &quot;Optometry&quot; (pictured here) and his collab with Dave Lombardo, &quot;Drums Of Death&quot;. He does have quite a few other fantastic albums outside of the purview of this show, though, and you'd serve yourself well to go into a deep dive if you can.

#### Talkie Time: _Cloak And Dagger Night_ - The Brenner Pass Story / The People In The Forest

Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain's 1946 book "Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS", Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I've inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it's absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren't currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work. 

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0012/07.jpg"><img src="/blog/0012/07.jpg" alt="Cover art to Crime Jazz Volume 4."></a></p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQmpjFmB9yg">Mr. Noir Guy's Thinking About The Crime</a> </p>
</div>

While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven't exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s--see also half of James Bond's catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it's still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.

This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and we'll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month's edition--namely, "The Eyes of Buddha" and "The Trap", which aired on July 2 and July 9, respectively, in 1950.

#### The Jazz Program Presents _CRIME JAZZ NIGHT!_ : Crime Jazz Volume 1, Disks 3 & 4

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don't know, we'll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We didn't get all the way through Disk 3 last time, so we'll be spinning it back and playing it and Disc 4 end to end.

----

That's the show lineup for this month! I'll be back soon with a Studio Update--it'll be a big one--as well as that new column I talked about last post.

Have a good one.

Footnotes...

[^1]: If memory serves and he's the one who does this particular section, Andy's "let the B3 be free" segment was what inspired my love for the sound of the Hammond organ.

[^2]: I tend to prefer what I lovingly call the "Washington Breakfast"--after the town [my home state's finest export](https://corncobpipe.com/) is based in--which is coffee and a pipe full of a strong VaPer blend. It's all the same thing in the end, I suppose.
