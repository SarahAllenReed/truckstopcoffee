Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of September of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

First, a bit of an interlude...

## TOI QUI M’AIMAIS, MOI QUI ADORAIS LE JAZZ

The standard [with a thousand faces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces) of jazz standards[^1], "Autumn Leaves" is one of the most played and beloved standards in jazz history. It also happens to be one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite, of all the jazz standards I've heard and enjoyed over the years. While I could go into the history of this great standard, including the gorgeous French love song by Jacques Prévert and Joseph Kosma which it originates from (and the lyrics of which the gag title of this section is a riff on), I'd rather leave that to those who came before me. You can check out KUVO's [fantastic writeup on their "Stories Of STandards" column here](https://www.kuvo.org/autumn-leaves-stories-of-standards/), enjoy a beautiful walkthrough of the original French for those of us who don't claim French as a first language [over here on Frenchlearner](https://www.frenchlearner.com/songs/les-feuilles-mortes-autumn-leaves-lyrics/), and check out what Performing Songwriter [has to say about the standard--and its poetic and silver-screen origins- here.](https://performingsongwriter.com/autumn-leaves/)

No, what I want to do here is gush about three of my favorite versions of the standard. Let's get into it.

_ARCHIE SHEPP - DEJA VU_

Starting this off with a cover of the original French, Archie's saxophone cries out at its most mournfull in this version of Les Feuilles Mortes. [Released on Japan's Venus Records](https://www.discogs.com/release/2568645-Archie-Shepp-Quartet-Deja-Vu), this sounds like it could have been on my beloved Shepp Quartet record [Blue Ballads](https://www.discogs.com/master/816157-Archie-Shepp-Quartet-Blue-Ballads), if Blue Ballads was recorded neck deep in the bottle and crying its heart out. Harold Mabern's piano playing on this track is absolutely superb as well, providing a melancholy hand on the listener's shoulder as Archie's saxophone wails out against the cruel world and the heartache it causes. The whole album is absolutely worth a listen, if for no other reason than [this track.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WELnsSZw-0Y)

_BEN WEBSTER - ATMOSPHERE FOR LOVERS AND THIEVES_

If Archie is drunk in the gutter, Missouri's own Ben Webster here's still upright at the bar--at least for now--with a smooth glass of whisky, a .45 tucked in his waistband, and a case and a dame that's troubling him something fierce. [Released on the legendary Black Lion label](https://www.discogs.com/release/1440529-Ben-Webster-Atmosphere-For-Lovers-And-Thieves), "Atmosphere For Lovers And Thieves" is an album that sets out to provide exactly what its title suggests, and the man from [Soulville](https://www.discogs.com/master/249088-The-Ben-Webster-Quintet-Soulville) comes through in aces. Smooth, easy, and with just enough swing to get your toe tapping while the sax and the liquor and the dim club lights keep you lost in thought, this particular version of the standard is another must-hear. [Check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eshngG4Xfww)

_TOM JONES - THE &QUOT;THIS IS TOM JONES&QUOT; TV SHOW (AND "ALONG CAME JONES", I GUESS)_

Yes, there was a Tom Jones television show. And yes, of course, my favorite [fake American](https://truckstop.coffee/post/0006/#the-jazz-program-tom-jones-pretends-to-be-an-american-for-two-hours-to-varied-but-amusing-results-tom-1970-darlin1981the-body-and-soul-of-tom-jones-1973) crooner covered "Autumn Leaves" on it. Surprising literally no one, it *easily* makes my list of favorite versions of the cover.

This version of the cover isn't the original appearance of this version, however; that honor belongs to Tom's debut, ["Along Came Jones"](https://www.discogs.com/release/2767023-Tom-Jones-Along-Came-Jones)--and/or ["It's Not Unusual"](https://www.discogs.com/master/371508-Tom-Jones-Its-Not-Unusual), the abridged re-release that owes its existence and title to [Carlton's favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WflKlxvwmYY) rocketing straight to number one in the US. So, if for some unknown reason, you *didn't* feel like watching Tom Jones walk through a mystical wooden landscape filled with dancers in the most '70s outfits known to man pirouette around our buddy Tom while he reminisces his heart out, you *could* go listen to it on there. But I mean, come on. [Go watch the video. You know you want to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6CFL41bkxY)

I definitely have quite a few other favorite versions--[Ol' Blue Eyes' version on "Where Are You"](https://www.discogs.com/release/1565097-Frank-Sinatra-Where-Are-You) definitely makes the cut--but if I keep rambling we'll be here all day.[^2] So, without further ado, here's the schedule for this month...

## September 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule

### September 5, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : The Thirty-Nine Steps, Part 1 (2001)[^3]

We don't often do back-to-back cliffhanger episodes, but we are tonight--and next week, as well. This evening, we've got the first of two nights worth of the BBC's 1989 adaptation of "The Thirty-Nine Steps", featuring John Buchan's proto-Bond, Richard Hannay.[^4] David Robb takes the lead role in this gripping search for a missing notebook. 

*sigh* No, not *that* notebook. Different notebook. This one's got German naval secrets and absolutely no Ryan Gosling in it, which makes it infinitely better than whatever this "The Notebook" has going on. Now go put that back on the shelf. We ain't watchin' that shit.

#### The Jazz Program LISTENER REQUEST NIGHT : Eloie's Blues Night

This month's Listener Request Night comes from long-time-listener and first-time-requester Eloie, who wanted to hear some of blues classics. She had a slew of possible belters for me to make a program from, and I picked three. We're listening to Disc One of Ma Rainey's compilation album "Mother Of The Blues, 1923-1928", Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald's 1958 live album "At Newport", and Nina Simone's "Sings The Blues", released in 1967.

  <p>not that notebook either jesus christ where do you keep finding these</p>
</div>

### September 11, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : The Thirty-Nine Steps, Part 2 (2001)

We don't often do back-to-back cliffhanger episodes, but we are this week. Finishing up what we started at the start of the month, we've got the second of two nights worth of the BBC's 2001 adaptation of "The Thirty-Nine Steps", featuring John Buchan's proto-Bond, Richard Hannay. David Robb takes the lead role in this gripping search for a missing notebook.... 

*sigh* No, not *that* notebook either. *Different notebook, dammit*. How did you even *find* that one? Come on, man. Give that back to Steve.

#### The Jazz Program : Gary Bartz - Another Earth (1969) / Ju Ju Man (1976) / Bartz (1980)

Miles Davis. Pharoah Sanders. Art Blakey And The Jazz Messengers. There aren't many greats that Gary Bartz *hasn't* played with, and there aren't many albums that have his name on the cover that aren't greats in their own right. We'll be listening to three of the master sax wielder's records tonight, starting with 1969's "Another Earth", then putting on '76's "Ju Ju Man" and closing it out with his foray into p-funk, 1980's "Bartz".

  <p>"Smoke if you got 'em" --Nero Wolfe, probably</p>
</div>

### September 19, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : New Adventures Of Nero Wolfe - Party For Death / A Slight Case Of Perjury

Everybody loves Nero Wolfe, whether they've figured it out yet or not. Archie Goodwin just never figures it out, but that won't stop him from doing the legwork...and the case work...and most of the work in general for tonight's programming. We've got two episodes of the world's biggest (in terms of weight class, anyways)[^5] detective for you this evening.

In order, we'll be listening to "The Party For Death", which originally aired on February 16, 1951, and "A Slight Case Of Perjury", which originally aired on October 25, 1950.

#### The Jazz Program : David Sanborn - Voyeur (1980) / Songs From The Night Before (1996) / Inside (1999)

Sometimes you just wanna hear some smooth, smooth jazz. I hope tonight's one of those nights for you, because we're listening to one of the modern masters of that sensual, silken sound. And hey--if tonight isn't one of those nights for you, or you just think you don't like smooth jazz, David Sanborn's here to change your mind with his smooth, smooth alto grooves. We'll be jumping through twenty years worth of Sanborn, with 1980's "Voyeur", 1996's "Songs From The Night Before", and 1999's R&B-minded "Inside"--which features a surprise vocal feature from none other than Sting on one of the tracks.

#### Talkie Time : Cloak And Dagger - Norwegian Incident / The Black Radio

Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain’s 1946 book “Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS”, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I’ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it’s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren’t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.

While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven’t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s–see also half of James Bond’s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it’s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0017/09.jpg"><img src="/blog/0017/09.jpg" alt="The cover art to Crime Jazz Volume 1, Disk 9."></a></p>
  <p>SYD DALE'S BRINGING CRIME BACK BAYBEEEE</p>
</div>

This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and we’ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month’s edition–namely, “Norwegian Incident” and “The Black Radio”, which aired on August 20 and August 27 respectively in 1950.

#### The Jazz Program CRIME JAZZ NIGHT - Crime Jazz Volume 1, Disk 9 - Syd Dale In Action!

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don’t know, we’ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. 

We’ll be spinning the ninth release in Volume 1, featuring the fantastic compositional work of film and television composer Syd Dale. Tune in.

That's the show lineup for this month! I'll be back soon with a Studio Update--it'll be a big one--as well as that new column I talked about last post.

Have a good one.

Footnotes...

[^1]: That's not hyperbole or allegory here; [Allmusic has well over a thousand versions listed.](https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/autumn%2520leaves) 

[^2]: I plan on doing a lil' section on one of these monthly schedule writeu-ps on my lifelong love affair with Sinatra anyways, and you bet I'll have plenty to say about "Where Are You?" as it is. So we'll keep my ramblings on that fine record for a later date.

[^3]: Minor correction here--the original version of this article stated (as the [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/HannayBBCr4) page says, albeit for the entirety of the Richard Hannay Adventures collection) that this aired in 1985. According to [the fantastic blog The Hitchcock Report](https://thehitchcockreport.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/the-39-steps-radio-adaptations/), this particular version aired on March 14, 2001. [You can view the full cast list on the.hitchcock.zone here.](http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/The_39_Steps_(BBC_Radio,_Mar/2001))

[^4]: If that name sounds familiar at all, and you happen to be a Hitchcock buff, you're right--[Hitchcock actually directed an adaptation of this novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Steps_(1935_film)) in 1939.

[^5]: Nero Wolfe, canonically, is said to weigh "a seventh of a ton"--or around 290lbs--by his creator and author Rex Stout. While that might make him the largest fictional detective as far as the golden age of crime solvers goes, that's only because his weight is *canonized in text*--Mycroft Holmes, brother of Sherlock holmes, is taller than his brother Sherlock--[who already stands at over six feet on his own](https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php/Sherlock_Holmes#Physical_appearance)--and is described as having a "body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother" (according to the short story "The Greek Interpreter"), but he only appears in four of the Doyle-written Holmes adventures and his weight is never canonically stated. If it *were,* though, there's good odds that Sherlock's brother would push Nero Wolfe clear off the throne of "largest detective in the classic era of detective fiction."
