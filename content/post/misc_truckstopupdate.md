## 2023

### July 3, 2023

* Added this update log!
* Formally added a bunch of features, including the Miscellany section, the Project Update Threads, and more.
* Added Listening List entries from when I started keeping track in mid-June, up through July 1st.
* Finished the first entry in How To Cook Shit
* Started in on two additional entries
* Minor CSS updates, including different colors when hovering over the menu

### July 4, 2023

* Added post 14, the Jazz Program schedule for July.
* Mucked with the CSS again, specifically to (hopefully) make links easier to sus out.
* Added a couple minor edits to Post 13.

### September 9, 2023

* Added posts 15, 16, and 17 over the past week, and photo rolls 4 and 5 this evening.
* Added a "word count/reading time" section to the front matter of each article, so you know what you're getting into before you get into it.
* Updated the Listening List to (mostly) be up-to-date.
* Added a couple readability edits to Post 9, and a redaction/correction to Post 13.
* Added a line explicitly stating disavowing all use of--and forbidding all training of--AI on this website to the sidebar, as well as a modified robot.txt that should keep away the webcrawlers and scrapers they use. Fuck AI "art" and "writing" and the damage it has done to this industry. 

### October 3, 2023

* Added in post 18.

### November 17, 2023

* Modified the sidebar to put "blog posts" and "photo rolls" in separate lists. I'm going to be doing a lot more photo roll posts so this was kind of necessary to keep things clean.
* Implimented [1337box](https://vimuser.org/1337box.html) on the Photo Roll pages. 
* Uploaded Photo Rolls 6-11, and post 19. Lots of photos!
* Added as many friends as possible to the Links page, as well as my RSS feed list and Freetube subscription list. 
* Added the Main Site update log.
* Added and edited the FAQ again. 
* Uploaded an actual photo of myself to the About page.
* Added in "Share To Mastodon" and "Share By Email" buttons.

## Todo List

* Finish implementing 1337box on all remaining pages where applicable.
* Make intro pages to the "Blog Posts" and "Photo Rolls" pages to explain what makes them special.
* Add alt text to everywhere it's not already implemented. I want to make this site as screen-reader friendly as possible.
* Add my Zettlekasten via [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com)
* Add my commonplace book.
* Actually finish adding all the links I want to add to the links page.
* Finish updated the Listening List to be as current as possible. *(Ongoing)*
