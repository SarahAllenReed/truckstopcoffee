## July 3, 2023

* Added this update log!
* Formally added a bunch of features, including the Miscellany section, the Project Update Threads, and more.
* Added Listening List entries from when I started keeping track in mid-June, up through July 1st.
* Finished the first entry in How To Cook Shit
* Started in on two additional entries
* Minor CSS updates, including different colors when hovering over the menu

## July 4, 2023

* Added post 14, the Jazz Program schedule for July.
* Mucked with the CSS again, specifically to (hopefully) make links easier to sus out.
* Added a couple minor edits to Post 13.

## September 9, 2023

* Added posts 15, 16, and 17 over the past week, and photo rolls 4 and 5 this evening.
* Added a "word count/reading time" section to the front matter of each article, so you know what you're getting into before you get into it.
* Updated the Listening List to (mostly) be up-to-date.
* Added a couple readability edits to Post 9, and a redaction/correction to Post 13.
* Added a line explicitly stating disavowing all use of--and forbidding all training of--AI on this website to the sidebar, as well as a modified robot.txt that should keep away the webcrawlers and scrapers they use. Fuck AI "art" and "writing" and the damage it has done to this industry.
