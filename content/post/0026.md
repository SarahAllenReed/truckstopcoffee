</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of May of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

### Talkie Time : That Hammer Guy - 14 Saddle Shoes / The Laura Fenton Case

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/01_01.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/01_01.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>pizza party hammer</p>
</div>

It's [not much of a secret](/post/0011/#mike-hammer-1990s-season-1) that I love the work of the master of hard-boiled detective fiction--one Mickey Spillane--and his '45-toting, lady-bedding, murder-murderin' antihero Mike Hammer. 

What *is* not nearly as well known, however (probably because only a select few of the shows survive to this day, none of which were in good enough quality for [OTRR](https://otrr.org) to take a swing at 'em) is that Spillane's PTSD-riddled lunatic with a gun had his own radio show for a decently lengthy period in the early '50s, penned not by Spillane but by Ed Adamson.

Sadly, we aren't going to be graced by the absolutely phenomenal (and pizza-loving) Stacy Keach incarnation of the hero tonight, but we've got two episodes of the original broadcast featuring both Larry Haines and Ted de Corsia as the titular Hammer guy.

Our Larry Haines spot this evening is "Saddle Shoes", which originally aired on April 7, 1953. Right after that, we've got Ted de Corsia stepping into the big man's shoes in "The Jim Gordon Case" (or ["Mike's Friend Murdered", if Old Time Radio Downloads is to be believed](https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/crime/that-hammer-guy)), which originally aired May 5, 1953.


### The Jazz Program : Wadada Leo Smith : Kulture Jazz (1993) / Luminous Axis: The Caravans Of Winter And Summer (2002) 

<div class="floatleft caption">

  <p>A modern master of free improv and one of the more interesting experimental voices from the '90s, '00s and even today. Wadada's horn work is something to behold.</p>
</div>

[International Worker's Day](https://archive.iww.org/history/library/misc/origins_of_mayday/) was May 1st, and while we didn't get to celebrate a day of worker's rights on the day of--or the day before, for that matter, [seeing as we had our listening party to attend to](http://localhost:1313/post/0025/#april-30-2024)--I did want to throw something a bit more left-of-center on the board to start the month off and get the party going.

Enter one Wadada Leo Smith -- [Tzadik alumni](http://www.tzadik.com/), multi-instrumentalist, and absolute force of nature who'll be giving us our soundtrack this evening. 

We're starting off with the 1993 release Kulture Jazz, featuring Wadada playing everything from trumpet to flugelhorn to mbira in a flowing, almost meditative river ride of a record. 

After that, it's time for something far more experimentational, with 2002's Tzadik release "Luminous Axis (The Caravans Of Winter And Summer), in which computer-led noise tables, free-improv trumpet and flugelhorn, and a particular ear for silence and the spaces between shows Wadada weaving some of the most complex pieces in his discography.

### Talkie Time : X Minus One - Saucer Of Loneliness / Venus Is A Man's World

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/02_01.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/02_01.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>"hey, if you think THIS is bad, this is only PURGATORY!" --crow</p>
</div>

Originally intended as a follow-up/revival of sorts to Dimension X (which we have yet to play on this show--don't worry, we'll get to it eventually), X Minus One devolved fairly quickly into a catch-all anthology of the works of some of the era's best science fiction writers adapted to drama and set to tape. This evening, we'll be spotlighting some of the...er...more *hormonal* adaptations on the latter half of those years. 

Sadly, Joel and the gang didn't answer my calls this week, or [we'd have them up front to give these the Hercules treatment.](https://youtu.be/NSPAHuvnuwA)

First up, we've got "Saucer Of Loneliness", written by one Theodore Sturgeon -- ironically the person who put [Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon) into the discourse -- which aired January 16th, 1957 and also ended up adapted on the inagural episode of the second season of The Twilight Zone. We won't be watching that adaptation tonight, sadly. I'm not saying the one we've got tonight is *bad*, but I *am* saying there sure are better.

After that, we've got "Venus Is A Man's World", originally aired on February 6th, 1957 and written by one William Tenn. I was wishy washy on the last one's quality, sure, but this one's a fantastic stinker--hell, [Project Gutenberg has the original version from the July 1951 issue of _Galaxy Science Fiction_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51150/51150-h/51150-h.htm) if you want to read it for yourself. 

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/02_02.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/02_02.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>jinkies, scoob</p>
</div>

To be honest, any joint whose second sentence reads "Put me on a spaceship jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble." is _bound_ to be a train wreck of camp--

--especially seeing as 1) this was written in the '50s, and 2) it turns out that, unfortunately for this poor sap, Venus is populated exclusively by buff, masculine, bishōnen men.

Or fortunately. Y'know, whichever. Hell, I'd have been into it.

### The Jazz Program : Wayne Shorter - Speak No Evil (1966) / Night Dreamer (1964) / Juju (1965)

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/02_03.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/02_04.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>The full cover art is incredible in its own right (click the image to see it), but I appreciate the cropping in the 1978 Japanese pressing, with the paper sleeve turning the already fantastic album cover into something worth of a Japanese horror flick's Criterion release.</p>
</div>

We've played exactly three tracks with Wayne Shorter in the band-leader position on this show--all three of which were for [Listener Request Night, and courtesy of long-time listener Lisafreak](http://localhost:1313/post/0006/#the-jazz-program-presents-_first-of-the-month-listener-request-night_--lisafreak-takes-the-decks)-- and it's time to correct that oversight. We've got three back-to-back Blue Note releases from (almost) back-to-back years from one of my personal favorite members of both Weather Report and The Jazz Messengers.

I say "almost" because I'd be remiss if I didn't lead with the latest in the trilogy--namely, 1966's _Speak No Evil_. One of the best hard bop records of the era, Speak No Evil is an absolute masterstroke, especially the hauntingly groovy and darkly understated third track, ["Dance Cadaverous"](https://youtu.be/mDPQovbowCA).

Next up is 1964's _Night Dreamer_, which features Blue Note's co-founder Francis Wolff on cover art duties with some of his fantastic street photography. That's not *entirely* uncommon--[Francis actually did quite a bit of the cover work for the label](https://www.discogs.com/artist/292019-Francis-Wolff?superFilter=Visual&creditFilter=Photography+By)--but the fact that the cover sports something other than a photo of the artist is relatively unique for the time, and shows a side of Wolff's photographic lense that isn't usually on full display.

We close out the evening with 1965's _Juju_, featuring Wayne playing with a stripped-down quartet sans brass and a much more up-tempo, lively set of compositions. The title track is the stand-out on this one, but all three records are worth a listen, and we'll be playing all three of them tonight. Come tune in.

### Talkie Time : Pat Novak, For Hire - Rita Malloy / Wendy Morris 


He's not real sure how he got into this mess. He's barely sure where he is right now. But he's got a boat to rent you, and that's what matters. Just please, for the love of god, try not to use it to haul a dead body wrapped in plastic halfway to [Nessie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness#Monster) doorstep? He's already had to deal with that twice this week, and he's tired of explaining to Inspector Hellman why his boat doesn't smell like dead fish as much as it does dead person.

With Jack Webb -- yes, Mister Friday From Dragnet himself -- in the titular role, Pat Novak is a down on his luck boat-hire guy who just cannot for the life of him find himself *not* in trouble with the law, often by either complete coy-inky-dink or because he needed the money and nobody bothered telling him what the money they're paying him was *for*. 

We've got two episodes of radio's most prolific patsy for you this week--namely, "Rita Malloy", originally aired May 23, 1949, and "Watch Wendy Morris", which originally aired the following week on May 30, 1949.

### The Jazz Program : Teru Sakamoto Trio - Let's Play Jazz Piano, Vol. 1-4

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Only pic I could find of the lads, ripped <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2581059-Teru-Sakamoto-Trio">straight from Discogs</a>.</p>
</div>

Born in 1949 in Echizen--["the city of artisans", according to japan-guide.com](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/echizen-city/)--in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, Teru Sakamoto is one of the better-kept secrets in the rare grooves of Japanese piano jazz. 

I could only track down a tiny bit of biographical information for this fantastic pianist or his two side projects, the Teru Sakamoto Trio and the Terry Herman Trio--hell, [even Last.fm comes up short](https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Herman+Trio/+wiki)--but what I do have is four utterly fantastic disks worth of cool piano jazz for your spring evening.

The series "Let's Play Jazz Piano" was released on four disks by the fine folks at Victor in 1977 and 1978, and every single track on here is a hidden gem. If you enjoy your piano soft and full of life with a bit of spring in its step--pun only partially intended--you're in for a treat tonight.
