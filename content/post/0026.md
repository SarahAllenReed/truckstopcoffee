</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of May of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

### Talkie Time : That Hammer Guy - 14 Saddle Shoes / The Laura Fenton Case

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/01_01.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/01_01.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>pizza party hammer</p>
</div>

It's [not much of a secret](/post/0011/#mike-hammer-1990s-season-1) that I love the work of the master of hard-boiled detective fiction--one Mickey Spillane--and his '45-toting, lady-bedding, murder-murderin' antihero Mike Hammer. 

What *is* not nearly as well known, however (probably because only a select few of the shows survive to this day, none of which were in good enough quality for [OTRR](https://otrr.org) to take a swing at 'em) is that Spillane's PTSD-riddled lunatic with a gun had his own radio show for a decently lengthy period in the early '50s, penned not by Spillane but by Ed Adamson.

Sadly, we aren't going to be graced by the absolutely phenomenal (and pizza-loving) Stacy Keach incarnation of the hero tonight, but we've got two episodes of the original broadcast featuring both Larry Haines and Ted de Corsia as the titular Hammer guy.

Our Larry Haines spot this evening is "Saddle Shoes", which originally aired on April 7, 1953. Right after that, we've got Ted de Corsia stepping into the big man's shoes in "The Jim Gordon Case" (or ["Mike's Friend Murdered", if Old Time Radio Downloads is to be believed](https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/crime/that-hammer-guy)), which originally aired May 5, 1953.


### The Jazz Program : Wadada Leo Smith : Kulture Jazz (1993) / Luminous Axis: The Caravans Of Winter And Summer (2002) 

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0026/01_02.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0026/01_02.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>A modern master of free improv and one of the more interesting experimental voices from the '90s, '00s and even today. Wadada's horn work is something to behold.</p>
</div>

[International Worker's Day](https://archive.iww.org/history/library/misc/origins_of_mayday/) was May 1st, and while we didn't get to celebrate a day of worker's rights on the day of--or the day before, for that matter, [seeing as we had our listening party to attend to](http://localhost:1313/post/0025/#april-30-2024)--I did want to throw something a bit more left-of-center on the board to start the month off and get the party going.

Enter one Wadada Leo Smith -- [Tzadik alumni](http://www.tzadik.com/), multi-instrumentalist, and absolute force of nature who'll be giving us our soundtrack this evening. 

We're starting off with the 1993 release Kulture Jazz, featuring Wadada playing everything from trumpet to flugelhorn to mbira in a flowing, almost meditative river ride of a record. 

After that, it's time for something far more experimentational, with 2002's Tzadik release "Luminous Axis (The Caravans Of Winter And Summer), in which computer-led noise tables, free-improv trumpet and flugelhorn, and a particular ear for silence and the spaces between shows Wadada weaving some of the most complex pieces in his discography.

### Talkie Time : X Minus One - No Contact / First Contact

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/02_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/02_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Herbert Marshall, otherwise known as The Man Called X. Look at this suave, suave motherfucker.</p>
</div>


### The Jazz Program : Wayne Shorter - Speak No Evil / Night Dreamer / Juju

  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/02_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/02_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>One of the most fascinating jazz records of the 1980s, period--hell, part of me wants to use its release in 1989 and subsequent Sony reissue in 1991 to state that it's also one of the most fascinating jazz records of the '90s as well.</p>

### Talkie Time : Pat Novak, For Hire - Rita Malloy / Wendy Morris 
<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/03_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/03_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>&quot;ey pal, the sign sais anythin' BUT moidah. you just can't be out here doin no MOIDAHS&quot; --pat novak, probably</p>
</div>

He's not real sure how he got into this mess. He's barely sure where he is right now. But he's got a boat to rent you, and that's what matters. Just please, for the love of god, try not to use it to haul a dead body wrapped in plastic halfway to [Nessie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness#Monster) doorstep? He's already had to deal with that twice this week, and he's tired of explaining to Inspector Hellman why his boat doesn't smell like dead fish as much as it does dead person.

With Jack Webb -- yes, Mister Friday From Dragnet himself -- in the titular role, Pat Novak is a down on his luck boat-hire guy who just cannot for the life of him find himself *not* in trouble with the law, often by either complete coy-inky-dink or because he needed the money and nobody bothered telling him what the money they're paying him was *for*. 

We've got two episodes of radio's most prolific patsy for you this week--namely, "Rita Malloy", originally aired May 23, 1949, and "Watch Wendy Morris", which originally aired the following week on May 30, 1949.

### The Jazz Program : Teru Sakamoto Trio - Let's Play Jazz Piano, Vol. 1-4

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Only pic I could find of the lads, ripped <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2581059-Teru-Sakamoto-Trio">straight from Discogs</a>.</p>
</div>

Born in 1949 in Echizen--["the city of artisans", according to japan-guide.com](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/echizen-city/)--in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, Teru Sakamoto is one of the better-kept secrets in the rare grooves of Japanese piano jazz. 

I could only track down a tiny bit of biographical information for this fantastic pianist or his two side projects, the Teru Sakamoto Trio and the Terry Herman Trio--hell, [even Last.fm comes up short](https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Herman+Trio/+wiki)--but what I do have is four utterly fantastic disks worth of cool piano jazz for your spring evening.

The series "Let's Play Jazz Piano" was released on four disks by the fine folks at Victor in 1977 and 1978, and every single track on here is a hidden gem. If you enjoy your piano soft and full of life with a bit of spring in its step--pun only partially intended--you're in for a treat tonight.
