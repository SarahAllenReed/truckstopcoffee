## What Is The Listening List?

In June of 2023, I started making a tiny thread on Mastodon about albums I was listening to in the gym and in the studio. While I tend to listen to music via [Newpipe](https://newpipe.net/) in the gym, I use [mocp](https://www.mankier.com/1/mocp) in the studio. It eventually hit me that I could just keep everything I listen to on MOCP saved in a folder of monthly playlists, and edit them down and put them up here.

Think of this as a more manual form of scrobbling via Lastfm. Every time I listen to something I haven't listened to in a while -- which is fairly often, to be honest -- I put it on the monthly playlist. Once the month's out, I edit down the playlist to only the albums themselves, and toss 'em up here.

It should be noted that I try to limit this to *only albums I haven't listened to before* since starting the list. I listen to a lot of albums on repeat--you can check out [The Usual Suspects](/post/misc_listen/#the-usual-suspects) list after this intro to find out which are most likely to be on there--but this is for novelties. Occasionally I'll forget and list an album twice; if that bugs you, [it may help to tell yourself that it's just a website, and you should really just relax.]()

Finally, I made the executive decision to *not* put in podcasts, old-time radio plays, or anything that isn't an album of some degree of musicality in here. While I could list every time I listened to an episode of Art Bell or Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar from my hard drive of archives, it'd get real old real quick to list every single one, air date and all, every time I do so. I often just navigate to a folder and hit "play" when I listen to those, so there'd be long stretches of YOURS TRULY JOHNNY DOLLAR YOURS TRULY JONNY DOLLAR YOURSTRULYJOHNNYDOLLAR and so forth if I had my favorite [insurance investigator](https://archive.org/details/OTRR_YoursTrulyJohnnyDollar_Singles) on the brain that day.

With that said, here's The Usual Suspects that you'll almost never see on this list, because I listen to them almost religiously.
