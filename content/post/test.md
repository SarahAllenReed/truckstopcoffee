Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of March of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>&quot;This Whole Thing Smacks Of Gender,&quot; i holler as i overturn the christmas tree and turn the March Programming List into the List Of S.H.I.T.</a></p>
</div>

We aren't playing any Christmas music this month on The Jazz Program--the concept of Christmas records as a whole are something i abhor to the point that i have virtually none in my collection at all--but we DO have a very special *ahem* corporate mandate from the all-powerful shrimpy deities over at [Shrimp Shake Co](https://youtu.be/ckaBRAJLock). that we *have* to do at least *something* goofy for The Holiday Season.

In fact, we have an entire list worth of mandates. An entire datatable worth of seasonal happenings that we have to divvy out in installments, lest we get our incredibly lucrative Internet radio paychecks in the form of Spicy Shrimp Shakes poured into a goo bomb and dumped in our mailbox again. It's called the Seasonal Happenings Installments Table, and we're taking one entry off of it every week this month and filling your radio with some holiday S.H.I.T.

...look man, you can complain if you want, but I'm still cleaning the habanero sauce and radioactive shrimp waste from last year's "Christmas performance bonus" out of the cracks in the mail room door, and I reeeally don't wanna do that again.

So, what's on the S.H.I.T. list this year? What are we playing on The Jazz Program if we're not blasting Mariah Carey like literally everyone else? Why doesn't that cute bear of a mall Santa return my calls? Some of your answers lie below....so read on, and let's get into it.
