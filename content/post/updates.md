The following is a series of progress threads for pieces that are announced, that I have permission to share the creation process of, and that I want to share with you. These all used to be up solely on social media, but in the interest of both wanting to have everything in one place and insisting upon [utilizing Indieweb principles](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) to make sure my work isn't lost to the ages for the umpteenth time thanks to the whim of some techno-jackanape, I'll be posting them here.

If you want to see my completed works, as well as the rest of my portfolio, [check out my main site at sarahallenreed.com!](https://sarahallenreed.com)

*Note: This list is VERY incomplete at the moment--I'm in the middle of a bunch of things and need time to collect all the work I've done (and am doing) on these projects and put it all in one place. I'm tossing it up as-is at this moment, though, and I'll be adding to it fairly constantly. *

*Note that there's a lot of process threads that I have up on social media but haven't migrated to here yet; those will be added in time. There's also a lot of projects of a more solo variety that I've announced but haven't either made enough headway on to make their own thread or haven't had the time to compile yet. Either way, dead links to things I have planned but haven't formally announced anything on yet will be accompanied by a &quot;COMING SOON&quot; tag. Check back soon; maybe they'll be up when you come visit next!*

## Comics (with friends)

### Our Lady Maven

"Our Lady Maven is the first in a series of books threading thematic elements through the early, mid, and late WWII time period with a high attention to historic detail both in terms of story and art elements (as well as genuine queer representation) Our Lady Maven spins an exciting fictional narrative without completely rewriting history. 

Many of the dates have even been kept intact in order to keep the plot grounded in truth, even when the story deviates from a factual historical account of the war.

Drawing on the true life story of legendary allied spies & saboteurs, Our Lady Maven examines the events leading up to the foundation of modern geopolitics. Just like in the real world, not all is as it seems at first glance in the world of Our Lady Maven."

Written by [Em Crose](https://hexadecim8.com), illustrated by yours truly.

You can check out the series [here](https://ourladymaven.com) and check out a compilation of all the updates I've made about the series, as well as some photo rolls of the series in progress, in the update thread here:

## Comics (solo)

### Snakes (COMING SOON)

"Snakes : A Brief And Personal History Of The War On Queer Bodies And The Ongoing Trans Genocide" is a strange hybrid of graphic memoir and journalism, documenting both my own childhood raised as an unwanted orphan and closeted trans femme in an abusive and extremely religious household and the history of the evangelical christian right-wing's assault on queer people. I've mentioned it a couple times, but I haven't made the update thread yet. That's coming with a (very near) future update. 

### Barren (COMING SOON)

BARREN, in its original form, was a graphic novel that was serially published in Tabula Rosetta in 2018; however, the book only saw three of its nine chapters completed before I broke down and ceased work on Tabula Rosetta. Last year, I ended up receiving a grant from [Koyama Provides](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVaV5LO-PW/) to work the first three chapters into a updated (and much more pitchable) state, only to find out when re-working it that I had a LOT of work to do. 

I still fully intend on rewriting and completing the book, but don't have anything to show for it just yet. When I do, I'll link it here.

### Cigarette Demo (COMING SOON)

I first teased this [in the March/April Studio Update](http://localhost:1313/post/0008/#cigarettes-demo), but neither Autumn nor I have been able to do much with it quite yet. Once we do, however, I'll post it here.
