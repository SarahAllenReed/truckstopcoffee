Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of March of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

## March 5, 2024 -- NO SHOW TONIGHT   

Yeah, sorry about that one; I've not been doing the best, to say the least, and I've also been adjusting to a new job I've taken on to help pay for some unforseen expenses I've had to deal with. So, for the [second night in a row](/post/0023.md), there was no program this evening.

### Talkie Time : Mysterious Traveler - Death Is The Visitor / Death Comes To Adolf Hitler

<div class="floatright caption">

  <p>got his ass</p>
</div>

We haven't done much on the program to celebrate the wonderful accomplishments of our good friend, The Grim Reaper, since he finally managed to achieve his lifelong goal of pulling everyone's [least favorite hell-bound war criminal](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/henry-kissinger-war-criminal-dead-1234804748/) out of the claw machine and out of our mortal plane. 

So, today, we've got two episodes of The Mysterious Traveler featuring our good hooded friend, as he goes and gets Hitler's ass and some other sad sappy sucker while he's at it. Narrated, as always, by everyone's favorite train-travelin' mystery man, played by the one and only Maurice Tarplin.

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/AU_Ak3t18Xc">iiii'm glad that you're deaaaad, henry kisingeerrrrrr...</a> hey, I didn't get any jabs in at him dying on this blog when it was relevant, but it's never too late to shit on a war criminal so we're getting 'em all in now.</p>
</div>

First off, we've got "Death Is The Visitor", originally aired on August 25, 1946, a tale about one of the most terrifying things known to man--overbearing mothers-in-law. And murder, of course. Can't be going out and having a show about murder without the murder, now. Mother wouldn't like that much.

Next up, we've got "Death Comes For Hitler", originally aired on March 14, 1945, in which Hitler gets his ass shoved on a U-boat to hell only to end up at the bottom of the ocean, tortured by ghosts. 

I'm not sure what Kissinger's up to in hell, but I'd imagine he's stuck in something similar. I'd say it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, but let's be honest here, most nice guys don't directly cause genocides.

[Anyways, I'll let Vulo take it from here.](https://youtu.be/AU_Ak3t18Xc) On to jazz we go.

### The Jazz Program : Dinah Washington - Dinah Jams / Dinah '62 / Back To The Blues

<div class="floatright caption">

  <p>An absolute masterpiece of the art. If you can't tune in to the show tonight to catch this, you owe it to yourself to find it on your own time and give it a listen. It's a masterpiece.</p>
</div>

Dinah Washington, for those of us who like our jazz vocal and our be-bops bopping, needs no introduction. Hailing from Tuscaloosa and bringing a voice that could blow up half the South, the self-proclaimed "Queen Of The Blues" has a catalogue of LPs that stretch from 1954 to 1963, all of which are certified bangers from front to back and a good portion of which are widely regarded as classics. We'll be taking a look at three of them tonight.

First up is 1963's "Back To the Blues", released on the Roulette label and features Dinah returning to her bluesy roots after making it to the top of the pop charts thanks to her single "Unforgettable". 

Next up is "Dinah '62", also released on Roulette and featuring an utterly stunning rendition of "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You", who fans of the show may recognize as [the source of a line I often quote from my favorite radio DJ](https://youtu.be/4yIYMGGKTrQ).

Finally, we have one of--in my *oh so humble opinion*--the greatest jazz records ever released, 1955's "Dinah Jams", released on the Emarcy label. If you stick around for no other reason, stick around for this--you won't regret it.
