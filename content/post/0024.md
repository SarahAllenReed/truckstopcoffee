</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of March of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

## March 5, 2024 -- NO SHOW TONIGHT   

Yeah, sorry about that one; I've not been doing the best, to say the least, and I've also been adjusting to a new job I've taken on to help pay for some unforseen expenses I've had to deal with. So, for the [second night in a row](/post/0023.md), there was no program this evening.

### Talkie Time : Mysterious Traveler - Death Is The Visitor / Death Comes To Adolf Hitler

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0024/01_1.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0024/01_1.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>got his ass</p>
</div>

We haven't done much on the program to celebrate the wonderful accomplishments of our good friend, The Grim Reaper, since he finally managed to achieve his lifelong goal of pulling everyone's [least favorite hell-bound war criminal](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/henry-kissinger-war-criminal-dead-1234804748/) out of the claw machine and out of our mortal plane. 

So, today, we've got two episodes of The Mysterious Traveler featuring our good hooded friend, as he goes and gets Hitler's ass and some other sad sappy sucker while he's at it. Narrated, as always, by everyone's favorite train-travelin' mystery man, played by the one and only Maurice Tarplin.

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0024/01_d.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0023/0024/01_d.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/AU_Ak3t18Xc">iiii'm glad that you're deaaaad, henry kisingeerrrrrr...</a> hey, I didn't get any jabs in at him dying on this blog when it was relevant, but it's never too late to shit on a war criminal so we're getting 'em all in now.</p>
</div>

First off, we've got "Death Is The Visitor", originally aired on August 25, 1946, a tale about one of the most terrifying things known to man--overbearing mothers-in-law. And murder, of course. Can't be going out and having a show about murder without the murder, now. Mother wouldn't like that much.

Next up, we've got "Death Comes For Hitler", originally aired on March 14, 1945, in which Hitler gets his ass shoved on a U-boat to hell only to end up at the bottom of the ocean, tortured by ghosts. 

I'm not sure what Kissinger's up to in hell, but I'd imagine he's stuck in something similar. I'd say it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, but let's be honest here, most nice guys don't directly cause genocides.

[Anyways, I'll let Vulo take it from here.](https://youtu.be/AU_Ak3t18Xc) On to jazz we go.

### The Jazz Program : Dinah Washington - Dinah Jams / Dinah '62 / Back To The Blues

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0024/01_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0024/01_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>An absolute masterpiece of the art. If you can't tune in to the show tonight to catch this, you owe it to yourself to find it on your own time and give it a listen. It's a masterpiece.</p>
</div>

Dinah Washington, for those of us who like our jazz vocal and our be-bops bopping, needs no introduction. Hailing from Tuscaloosa and bringing a voice that could blow up half the South, the self-proclaimed "Queen Of The Blues" has a catalogue of LPs that stretch from 1954 to 1963, all of which are certified bangers from front to back and a good portion of which are widely regarded as classics. We'll be taking a look at three of them tonight.

First up is 1963's "Back To the Blues", released on the Roulette label and features Dinah returning to her bluesy roots after making it to the top of the pop charts thanks to her single "Unforgettable". 

Next up is "Dinah '62", also released on Roulette and featuring an utterly stunning rendition of "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You", who fans of the show may recognize as [the source of a line I often quote from my favorite radio DJ](https://youtu.be/4yIYMGGKTrQ).

Finally, we have one of--in my *oh so humble opinion*--the greatest jazz records ever released, 1955's "Dinah Jams", released on the Emarcy label. If you stick around for no other reason, stick around for this--you won't regret it.

### Talkie Time : Boston Blackie - Evelyn Jones Murder / Hypnotic Murder

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0024/02_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0024/02_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>The 1941 movie, &quot;Meet Boston Blackie&quot;, is also very much worth a watch, with Chester Morris in the role he would later reprise on the airwaves.</p>
</div>

Created by author Jude Boyle, played by Chester Morris for the first few episodes and Richard Kollmar for the two we'll be hearing tonight, and often found getting into places he shouldn't be in, Boston Blackie is one of the few true anti-heroes in old time radio. "An enemy to those who make him an enemy, and friend to those who have no friend" as the show calls him, Blackie spends his time on the air cracking safes, solving crimes (usually ones he ends up being the fall guy for) and punching bad...er, bad*der* guys than him in the jaw. 

We've got two episodes of the [Gentleman Jim Stacey-ass](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Gentleman_Jim_Stacey) boy tonight. First up, it's "Evelyn Jones Murder", originally aired on August 13, 1945, in which Blackie bungles a blackmail case only to have the resulting dead body -- and the rest of the crime scene, to boot -- pull their own disappearing act.

Next up, it's "Hypnotic Murder", originally aired on August 6, 1949, in which Inspector Farraday has Blackie framed for a crime he didn't commit (again) because Blackie made the mistake of trying to help an old friend (again) and now his fingerprints are all over a murder weapon (you'd think he'd be wise to this after the first couple times c'mon man). 

Don't find yourself framed for murder--tune in tonight. Now -- for legal reasons, of course -- I'm not saying I'd frame you for murder if you didn't show up. I'm just telling you that I might consider it. No pressure.

### The Jazz Program : Bobbi Humphrey - Satin Doll (1974) / Blacks And Blues (1973) / Fancy Dancer (1975)

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0024/02_2.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0024/02_2.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>If you've listened to this show, you know I hold quite a few flautists in high regard. As far as I'm concerned, Bobbi is damn close to the top of the tier list.</p>
</div>

There were many fantastic women in the jazz scene in the '70s, but only one has the unique distinction of being the first instrumentalist ever signed to Blue Note. That honor belongs to one Bobby Humphrey, one of the greatest to ever put wind to the silver stick. Born in Marlin, raised in Dallas, and signed to the Note only weeks after first setting foot in the Big Apple, Humphrey's flautist chops are only truly rivalled by the mark she made on jazz at the time and continues to make on DJs and sample-flippers today.

We've got three fantastic albums from The First Lady Of Flute for you this evening. First up is 1974's "Satin Doll", easily one of my favortes from her oeuvre. 

Next up, we've got 1973's "Blacks And Blues", her first release with Blue Note. If I can point to one record in these three that justifies my claim about her effect on sample-flippers, it's this one--[connoiseurs of sound who have used this record](https://www.whosampled.com/Bobbi-Humphrey/Blacks-and-Blues/sampled/) in their own work include Quebec group La Constellation, MF DOOM's original group KMD, and New York's own Eric B. And Rakim.

And finally, we've got 1975's "Fancy Dancer", her fifth release on Blue Note and one that very much showcases exactly how versatile she could be. All three of these records are worth a listen, and I hope you can join us tonight as we give these a look.
