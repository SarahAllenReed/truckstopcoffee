Hey ya'll! Sorry for the delay, again, but I've got a whole bunch of studio news, life updates, and the like for ya. This one's a bit long, so settle in and get comfortable. 

Also, some things on this list include some heavier topics; I've went ahead and put a content warning both on those posts and on the titles of the sections in the table of contents, so if you're not in the headspace for some heavier topics you can go ahead and skip past.

Here's what I've been up to, where I've been at, and where I plan to go from here.

## WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON 

### OUR LADY MAVEN & THE GARDEN

Both are coming along, albeit slowly (we'll get into that more in the [Depression](/post/0022/#depression-isolation-and-family-or-a-lack-thereof-content-warning) section) here in a bit. I'm finishing up through Page 8 of Issue 2 of OLM now, and putting final finishing touches on the first Garden short as well. 

My goal at this point is to try and hit a set quota in order to prioritize these two projects to get them moving a bit quicker than they have been, and once the quota on that front is done for the month I start in on the next thing we'll talk about. 

I wish it was easier for me to stay moving on things when I'm on the outs (although I have a goal and a rough plan to get better about that this year, [which we'll talk about in a later segment](http://localhost:1313/post/0022/#six-threes-for-the-new-year)), but I'm going to do my best to keep this rolling and hopefully make even more progress on these works this year. I think you'll all enjoy how much the drama and tension rachets up by the end of the second issue of OLM, and I'm very much looking forward to fleshing out the world of The Garden more as well.

### BARREN & LILIES ON ACHERON

BARREN is coming along decently well enough, and the [last time it came up on this blog](/post/0017/#barren-ghosts-and-lines-of-succession) I had mentioned serially publishing it in the pages of a spiritual successor to Tabula Rosetta.

This successor's name will be Lilies On Acheron, named both for the river of souls which one can only cross and never linger upon, and for the *Nymphaea* which dance across its surface regardless.

  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/01.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/01.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Inks on the drawing board for the new version of BARREN.</a></p>
</div>

I'm currently working on drafting some smaller, stand-alone side stories for each issue, and hopefully inks will start on those once I finish up with the short I'm doing with Cab and get at least half of the inks on OLM down and in the bag. 

I will say that one thing that I would not expect to carry over from TR would be the more autobiographical content. At this point, I just don't want to write about my own life in this medium (you could argue, given how fractured everything is in TR, that I didn't want to do it *then* either) and I don't think anyone really wants to read about it either unless it fits into some larger narrative. At this point, expect it to be paintings, fictional worlds, and poems, and not much else.

I would expect that sentiment to apply directly to Snakes as well, so don't expect to see much in the way of that story in the pages of LoA[^1]. I want to keep this series confined to my storytelling this time around.

Speaking of Snakes...


### SNAKES, DOOMERISM, AND WHY THIS IS TAKING SO FUCKING LONG (CONTENT WARNING)

---

I'm guessing a few of you are asking "hey, what happened to that giant manuscript you were working on about the history of the religious right's persecution of trans folk in the United States? We haven't heard anything about it [since last May!](/post/0022/#depression-isolation-and-family-or-a-lack-thereof-content-warning)"

And to tell you the truth, it once again almost got scrapped. This section is a bit long and rambling, so I apologize in advance, but I wanted to touch on a bit of why it's been so difficult, where my head has been at, and why I honestly think that if I don't write this no one else will or could.

---

<img class="floatleft" src="/heavysm.png"/> 

***Fair warning: the following segment talks about an in-progress book of mine that covers a particularly heavy topic--namely, the ongoing mistreatment of--and attempted genocide of--the transgender and queer population by certain far-right subsects of the American religious right wing and the cooresponding factions of the American government.***

***This segment also goes into certain topics--namely, my own struggle with suicidal ideation, doomerism, and loss of community--that I do feel the need to put an additional trigger warning for here.***

***I know not everyone has the spoons to read about these things right now, or even read about an in-progress book about it--lord knows I barely have the spoons to write about it--so if you're not in a good place or just would prefer to skip ahead to the next section, go on ahead.***

#### I. A UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE PILOTS THAT MADE IT BACK

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/02.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/02.jpg" alt="The artist's writing desk, with the Novelwriter project open for SNAKES, as well as various writing, note-taking, and reading accoutrements splayed across the desk's surface."/></span></p>
  <p>Drafting.</a></p>
</div>

There is a piece I have kept in the "read" section of the reference folder that I just cannot seem to move to the "notes taken" section[^2], much less get out of my head. 

It's a Wired article called ["When Social Media Presents An Unlivable Life"](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-trans-rights/) by [Katherine Alejandra Cross](https://quinnae.com/), and--on the surface, at least--it's a damn good article, putting forth a compelling voice to a plea I often hear among other trans folk against doomerism and despair, a plea for sharing trans community positivity and trans joy in the face of overwhelming attacks on trans people.

You might have noticed that, where I usually would use the line "people like us" when referring to trans folk, I didn't use it at the end of the last paragraph. There's a reason for that, and the reason is *why* this article doesn't seem to want to leave my subconscious. 

There are throwaway lines, simple statements of fact painted as near universal experience, scattered throughout the article. These aren't things that are detrimental to the article; if anything, they're critical to the content of it. Depictions of the author's relationships, friendships, and comraderie found with other queer folk flood the paragraphs when she talks about her life. Images of community, self-fulfillment, and a newfound sense of self-worth and happiness abound. 

And then, near the end, you find this paragraph that guts me like a fish.

> That parliament of memory isn’t something that fits easily on social media, but it’s real, and it has its reflections and echoes in the lives of every trans person.    

>  It’s why the most common reaction I see to before-and-after photos is:   

>  “You look so much happier now.”    

> <i>Katherine Alejandra Cross, ["When Social Media Presents An Unlivable Life"]("https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-trans-rights/)</i>


<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/02.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/02.png" alt="The survivorship bias graphic. From Wikipedia: &quot;This hypothetical pattern of damage of surviving aircraft shows locations where they can sustain damage and still return home. If the aircraft was reinforced in the most commonly hit areas, this would be a result of survivorship bias because crucial data from fatally damaged planes was being ignored; those hit in other places did not survive.&quot;"/></span></p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">A lot of the places the shots I've taken have landed aren't usually recorded here.</a></a></p>
</div>

I didn't have any of these experiences. Hell, I don't even have any photos of me, seeing as at some point [after a particularly traumatic event in my transition](/post/0009/), I deleted all of the photos that used to exist of me, leaving only a select few. And, if anyone who knew me pre-transition was still in my life, I doubt they'd say I look happier now. If anything, I probably just look more stressed, angrier, more miserable.

I feel like I'm *expected* not to be like this, but I don't know *how* to be. My transition has not made me happier--it's made me more *whole* yes, but it's put my life more in danger, caused most people I've met to treat me like garbage, caused me to lose jobs, friends, support, resources. 

And as a result, I often feel out of place in the conversation. Transition didn't "fix" everything about me, and so I sit in isolation, away from the tables of people for whom it *did*.

I don't put this anecdote here to dunk on Katherine--she's right. We need more trans joy. All of us do, including and especially folks who are sitting in the cheap seats, and even moreso the folks like myself who find ourselves outside the venue trying to stand on the back of the truck and get just enough height over the fence to get to see the joint at all. I don't begrudge her the happiness that has filled her life since transition, any more than I envy any other trans person who can claim to have survived the climb to the mountain and found their way to community there. I legitimately wish her the best.

And to be honest, I hope she never finds this link, because the last thing I want her to do is think I'm singling her out here--if for no other reason than she's not the only trans author whose work I'm pouring over while doing research on Snakes that has done this. Nearly every single trans researcher whose work I'm indebted to, nearly every trans person I've met, are very adamant that they got here because they had a community, a family, some kind of often overwhelming support. Family, friends, love, fulfillment, all kinds of sources of joy.

And genuinely, I'm happy for all of you. I just am not you. 

I just don't have that story, that experience. I would *like to*, and lord knows I have *tried* to, but at this point and from where I'm sitting I can't lay claim to trans joy with the type of trans experience I have had. And the more I work on this book, the more the violent levels of vulnerability and alienation contained in that simple fact eats away at me as I try and write my own story.

There is a little devil in my ear who thrives on my depression and misery. That devil loves to try and wedge it into my skull that I am not of a financial class or social strata who can lay claim to that kind of transformative joy that comes from a transition that did not destroy me, and that I do not belong in the conversation as a direct result.

On research nights, you can often find him perched on my earlobe, screaming 

*using the phrase 'people like us' in place of 'trans folk' doesn't work here. you have not had those experiences. you are not like them. you are not one of them.* 

*'people like us' does not include you.*

What makes this so taxing is the fact that on paper--and in the eyes of a lot of the more lucky queer folk I've ever told my story to--that devil is right.

#### II. QUEER AUTOBIO AS ASPIRATIONALISM AND WHY I'M NOT WELCOME AT PARTIES

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/02_1.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/02_1.png" alt="A Reddit post on a meme subreddit, with a gif saying &quot;me having survivors guilt as a post everything trans woman"/></span></p>
  <p>I'm not gonna link to this post (or its absolutely fucked comment section) here, but I want to point out that I see shit like this on a lot of trans forums, Discord servers, and the like. I've seen or heard something to this effect of this sentiment at least once a week since starting my transition.</p>
</div>

I often don't talk publicly about my transition--choosing instead to just lean into making jokes about gaying up the place if I mention publicly that I am trans at all when I'm goofing about on Mastodon--but one of the things I've found that differentiates myself from a lot of the other trans folk I have talked to is *why* I decided to transition.

A lot of the other trans folk I've met finally pulled the trigger once they were safe, once they had a support network, once they reached some milestone where they could have *done* something about it. I didn't have that luxury. 

When I came out as trans in 2016, it was after a harrowing four years of being out as gay in rural Missouri. I spent most of those four years homeless. I lost jobs, had slurs written on my locker at work, got disowned, lost nearly all of the very little support I did have, the whole nine yards. 

When I came out as trans, it was because I was tired, I had known I was trans for a long ass time, and I figured things were never going to get better anyways so I may as well pull the trigger. I honestly did not think anything could get much worse. 

Six years later, here we are, and I guess I know now how foolish I was for tempting the devil like that. 

There's a reason this article has stuck in my head, and a reason why I've struggled to keep working on this book at times. There is a layer of separation between who we, as a community, want to hear from, what kinds of stories we wish to hear, and who I am as a person and what my experiences have been. 

Like most human beings, we want to hear the aspirational tales; love, happiness, beauty. If we hear about trans liberation and the forces against us, we want to hear that from people who have succeeded in *having* those things, who *can* offer us a living example that there *is a way out*, who can embody through their experiences that there *is* a better future.

I have not had a future for most of my life, even well before my transition. This book specifically has mostly been a torturous affair filled with ghosts of our dead elders and battles with my own traumatic memories surrounding how people have responded to my own queerness, all of which I undertake at ungodly hours with no outlet and no recourse should I become overwhelmed with the violent gravity of it all. 

<div class="floatright caption">

  <p>Shoutout to <a href="https://masto.deoan.org/@neurovagrant">Ian Campbell</a> on Masto for posting this. I'm not directly talking about suicidality here in this post, but it would not take much of a scope expansion for me to do so.</p>
</div>

Unlike most of the trans folk whose research I have been spending countless nights with, I don't have anyone to really talk about this research to, much less to drag me away from it and get me out of my head for a while. To be frank, I don't have much of a support network at all, and the fact that I even have the tiny fragments of support I do to the degree I do is a relatively recent development, especially compared to the isolation of the past few years. I don't state that as a public plea for attention, mind--I state it as a matter of fact. The support most folk have had, even to the bare minimum, has not been there in my life. That makes this kind of thing much more difficult, and making it palatable or providing glimpses of hope in the text near impossible.

I can offer you nothing resembling trans joy, and I am fully aware of it. All I can offer you is the experiences of the human equivalent of the end result of the societal alienation and violence the right wants to enact upon all of us, that exact "doomerism" that no one wants to think about.

You would think that would make me the exact person who *should* be writing about this topic. When I started this, I would have agreed with you. There are days where I still do.

Then there are days when I honestly do not think anyone would care if I told this story at all; or worse, days when I have been explicitly told *not* to tell it by other trans folk, who would rather not care about the casualties and would rather focus on the wins they've been fortunate enough to have, *even if that means that I and people with my less-than-positive experience are pushed from any potentially supportive community as a result*.

The past few years have been filled with many more uncaring voice than motivated days, I'm afraid.

#### III. YOU HAVE NO WINGS, YOU DO NOT FLY

One of the other stories by trans women that my mind has returned to while working on this book--as well as throughout my transition--is ["people with wings"](https://persenche.medium.com/people-with-wings-9e554ac571ae), by [Kiva Maginn](https://persenche.medium.com/).

I would summarize it for you as a metaphor for classism and "acceptable losses" in the trans community couched in a parable of spiritual ascension, the trauma of abandonment, and ignored casualties, but I'd rather you simply go read it. Seriously. Go ahead, open that link in a new tab and come back to this paragraph when you're done. I think you'll get *why* I brought it up in this context once you do.

I will, however, put one paragraph from it here which, I suppose, sums up why I haven't joined the casualty statistic of trans women who have taken their own lives, as well as why I keep working on this.

> "You see fewer and fewer people. Most people don’t make it this far up the mountain. There was a study on the number of people who turn back, which is not as many as you would have thought, and the number of people who give up and either fall or stay on the mountain until they run out of dried fruit and jerky and snow melt, and just fall asleep forever. Which is a lot more than you’re really comfortable with. It’s one of the few conversations you have with the other pilgrims when you overtake them or are overtaken. Why are we doing this, when we know how few people make the summit? "    

>  "The answer is always a shrug, understood to mean   

> <strong>‘because what else are we supposed to do?"</strong>   

> <i>Kiva Maginn, ["people with wings"](https://persenche.medium.com/people-with-wings-9e554ac571ae)</i>

To be quite frank, I don't see myself ever making it up that mountain. I don't even see the trek up becoming any easier, either. 

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/03.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/03.jpg" alt="The author's desk, planning chapter 2 of an upcoming manuscript. Multiple computers, a word processor, the author's zettelkasten and multiple cards from it, a lit pipe, a cup of coffee, and a white legal pad are scattered across the desk."/></span></p>
  <p>Running full bore into the mountain and starting to dig.</a></p>
</div>

I also don't really know of anything else I *could* do, other than to keep going and hope that one day I'll wake up whole. 

And I'm not sure what other path there is for me other than to keep fighting these assholes and my own mental as long as it's humanly possible for me to do so. And I'd rather spend the time I had causing as much trouble for those oppressors as possible, and doing whatever good I *can* do in the meantime.

No one else *could* write this exact book, and if anyone is going to it may as well be me.

And, on that front, I have found someone willing to help out with getting it out once I've got some of it finished, as well as a few more leads thanks to a friend on Mastodon that should make the whole picture a lot easier to paint. I'll write more about that in the next update once it's all confirmed. I just wanted to give an update so y'all know I'm not dead, and that neither is this book.

And now, with that bit of fight on the table to send us off, let's move to a lighter topic (albeit one that somewhat falls along the same lines)...

### JAZZY FUCKIN' HOLIDAYS!

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/04.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/04.png" alt="An OBS window and SegaCD emulator KegaFusion."/></span></p>
  <p>hey chief what's up with that vase you got there</a></p>
</div>

If you missed it, Thanksgiving and Christmas were the third annual Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays charity marathons over on datafruits.fm. We spun records for 24 straight hours all day on Thanksgiving, and then upped the ante on Christmas by also completing a full playthrough of Hideo Kojima's "Snatcher", which Is A Christmas Game And You Cannot Convince Me Otherwise[^3].

The insectors segment near the very end proved to be a pain in the ass, as it always does, but thankfully Autumn is much better at video games than I am and I talked her into beating it for me....albeit with a fight stick, because it turns out every other USB controller in the house has some serious lag issues and that was about all we had left to try. I don't know if that's a first of any kind, but it was at the very least funny to watch.

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/05.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/05.png" alt="The datafruits.fm chat window, absolutely covered in .pngs of Astolfo, .gifs that say I AM TRANSGENDER, a color reversed clip from &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; for some reason, and other noisy bullshit. The chat is going absolutely wild for it for some reason."/></span></p>
  <p>The kind of bullshit you can expect from me around the 21 or 22-hour mark when you let me run a 24 hour charity marathon.</a></p>
</div>

Finally, once we beat down the Snatcher menace, I just gave up on reasonable behavior and decided to kickstart the party at the 11th hour by breaking my computer and the OBS stream simultaneously, which resulted in the absolute nonsense you see here. Honestly, I probably need a new desk compy after this. I think all the .gifs and nonsense broke the fan.

A big "thank you" to everyone who showed up and everyone who donated as well. I don't usually keep a donation ticker in the chat for these--my main reason for hosting them is to make sure no one has to spend Christmas or Thanksgiving alone, and I've always kind of felt that turning them into a donation ticker would put some undue pressure on a lot of the members of our community who are down and out and can't donate at this time. I will, however, give a warm thank you to everyone who did donate to The Trevor Project and to Trans Lifeline during the stream. You're all truly wonderful.

Thanks for spending yet another jazzy holiday season with me, and I very much look forward to seeing you dorks next year.

### SHOP CLOSURE UPDATE

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/06.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/06.png" alt="The mainentance mode page on the Blackwork web store. It reads: We're working on our site at the moment. Please check back soon."/></span></p>
  <p>we closed</a></p>
</div>

Finally--and this is a big one--every single item in the [BLACKWORK. shop](https://blackwork.org) has now been shipped, and the shop is now formally closed for the forseeable future. I stated last time that I was planning on doing it, but [due to how fucked I've been through the holiday season](/post/0022/#depression-isolation-and-family-or-a-lack-thereof-content-warning) as well as me just being shite at administrative tasks and executive functioning on a normal day, I forgot to actually log in to the admin page and close the thing so a couple orders slipped through. Those are now shipped, as well as every single outstanding order on top of that.

I am fully aware of how long these orders have taken to get out the door, and I cannot apologize enough for why it took that long. If you're still waiting on some joints from me, they should be there soon.

It has also occurred to me that it has been a long-ass time before anything new has actually graced the shop at all. There are still zines up there from fucking 2016, and the most recent one is functionally three years old at this point.

I want to get my shit together a bit more, get a schedule figured out so this kind of giant gap between you ordering and me shipping never happens again (ideally I'd like to get a routine so that it only takes a week max), and more than anything I want to get new shit in the shop. So, until that happens--probably around the release of Issue 1 of Lilies On Acheron--the shop will remain closed.

## WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO

### DEPRESSION, ISOLATION, AND FAMILY OR A LACK THEREOF (CONTENT WARNING)

---

<img class="floatleft" src="/heavysm.png"/> 

***Fair warning: this one isn't as heavy as the section on Snakes, but i do directly go into a lot of what i've been struggling with over the holiday season, which directly includes my own struggle with disownment, trans issues, isolation, and other shit things to read about.***

***I wouldn't put them here if I didn't think they were worth telling, but I know not everyone has the spoons to read about these things right now.*** 

***So, as always: if you're not in a good place or just would prefer to skip ahead to the next section, go on ahead.***

---

I've dealt with a lot of harsh shit over the past few years, and while I don't think I want to talk about *all* of it at length yet (if I ever feel comfortable doing so[^4]), I do want to touch on one particular aspect of what's been going on in my own personal life. I'll get into it more at a later date when I talk about [my name change](/post/0022/#names-the-big-one) on a longer, dedicated post, but I feel like it bears bringing up now since we're talking about this past winter anyways.

A couple years back, I finally heard from my birth family for the first time in my entire life. It turns out that the family that raised me is, as of a few years now, not the only one I have been disowned from or that is uninterested in having me around because of who I am. 

This past winter has been the first one in which I have dealt with that fact sober, and to say that it has been rough is an understatement. To put it in raw statistics, [being disowned by one family increases risk of suicide attempts in trans folk by fifty percent.](https://www.hrc.org/news/family-acceptance-saves-lives) I think I'm the only person I know of who has been tossed to the wolves by *two different families.* 

Granted, it's been a good ten years plus since I was tossed to the curb by the abusive family that raised me, and while that never gets easier one does become more calloused to it. That didn't make the second one hit any less hard, though, especially given what I was going through at the time).

Finding out who one's birth family is (save my mother; still dead as a doornail since the day of my birth, unfortunately, and I didn't even know her name until my mid-twenties) out of the blue only to find out that *they* don't particularly want you around either...even taken in isolation, that's a whole lot of gravel tossed in an engine block already caked with sand and long past its retirement date. Sure, I was able to keep that proverbial engine going for at least some time by filling it with spit, vinegar, and a whole lot of liquor, but once I stopped drinking the whole thing stopped having minor breakdowns and just totalled itself instead once the holidays hit this year.

Most people, I imagine, deal with this by reaching out to friends, spending time with them, asking for help. I remember trying to do so with the few IRL folk I thought would be there for me in my life back when I first found out that my birth family wanted nothing to do with me, and I was just..kind of more or less abandoned by those people for reaching out and asking for help. Maybe I wasn't that high on the priority list, maybe they didn't have the spoons to deal with me, maybe they just thought I deserved it. No matter the reason, no matter how valid said reason was, the result was still the same. 

So I did what I had been doing for a year and some change at that point--I turned further inward, and I drank, filling my belly with liquor so I didn't become overcome with grief and become yet another tally on a transphobe's favorite statistic. And while, sure, the liquor mostly kept me going at the time, that didn't mean it wouldn't come back to bite me later.

Fast forward to now, of course, and once the holiday season started all of those emotions and memories hit me square in the jaw at once, then over and over and over again every single night, memories bouncing off the edges of my subconsiousness and walloping my skull like a boxer who has his opponent on the ropes without a ref to step in and call the bell to stop the massacre. 

Didn't take long before I conked and hit the mat, and that mat's where I stayed for most of this winter. 

There was a lot of time over the end of 2023 that I just spent weeks at a time in bed, unable to do much. There's a reason why I [formally closed commissions](/post/0017/#getting-my-shit-together) at the beginning of fall; I was not in a place where I could get out of bed for weeks at a time, much less guarantee a reasonable two-to-four-week turnaround. I did get a few things done, sure, but for the most part I was more or less collapsed and non-functional. 

The holidays are over now, though, and I'm still here, now with at least some of my usual spit and vinegar back in my bloodstream to boot. I'd say I'm going to be trying to take it easy for my mental's sake, but I clearly just wrote a whole section of this about Snakes so if I did I'd be fulla shit. Just know that I should be a bit more in fighting shape now, and hopefully this coming winter won't be nearly as bad.

I do want to give a shout out here--If it weren't for Autumn being the closest I have on this earth to a sister and going out of her way to take care of me, I'd probably not be here right now. Hell, were it not for her I'd have probably left this world when it happened all those years back. If there's anyone y'all should be thanking for me being here to keep writing these stories and drawing these pictures y'all love so much, much less getting sober in the first place, it's her.

Speaking of sobriety...

### ONE YEAR SOBER

Yup. Reached one year in November. 

Someone I know once told me about an old head they worked with at one point. Whenever anyone asked him about his sobriety, he simply stated "I miss it like an old friend".

Sometimes, old friends need to stay dead, whether they kept you alive at one point or not. 

I don't have anything else positive to say about it. I'm sure you all were expecting me to, but I don't. 

As I alluded to in the previous section, the liquor kept me alive when I needed it to. Clawing my way back to sobriety was rough, but it's more or less done now. Hopefully my life will never get that bad again.

....I'd knock on wood but I'm fairly certain even wood hates my guts at this point.

### RECOVERY, CAMERAS, AND LEARNING TO PAINT AGAIN

> "Picasso co-founded the Cubist movement by challenging artistic perspectives. Emily Dickinson wrote poetry breaking syntactic rules, which only gained fame after her rebellious death. Dozens of publishers rejected Dr Seuss's weird, imaginative children's poems, concerned they wouldn't sell before becoming classics. Frida Kahlo leveraged her disability from polio as a creative force for her unique painting. Great artistic discoveries have emerged more from obsessive focus than a calculated business plan."    
 
> "What unifies these creators is a common thread of inner passion that manifested despite not conforming to commercial viability standards. Creations that shift our culture are rarely strategically planned from scratch for monetary goals. Creative breakthroughs arise from irrational psyches that overflow toward the external world. They erupt from the raging volcano of human inner lives seeking expression."

</div>

There's no burying the lede here. On top of everything else I've gone through this past bit, the fact is that I've spent the past few years of my career trying--and failing miserably--to keep up with a very specific kind of creative cycle that does not work for me whatsoever. And it has absolutely destroyed me. 

I have not finished a personal work in *literal years* at this point[^5]. No finished ink renders for my own personal reasons, no paintings for the love of paint. I've mostly forgotten how to paint and draw things I love and care about, because to be frank I've been having to spend that time on commission work and on trying to chase some manner of commercial acclaim or acceptance in more mainstream-adjacent indie comics spaces. 

I am not exactly the kind of creative who fits well within a mold. And the types of spaces I've been trying to find work in aren't the types of spaces who work well for those who do not. They do not want my ass around, and I'm kind of tired of appeasing them. 

So, [back in November](/post/photoroll07/), I bought a camera. An old-school DSLR, to be precise. And I've been [taking time, every so often, to head out and go shooting](/post/photoroll14/). It gets me out of the house, gives me something to do and somewhere to go, and more importantly provides reference photos for paintings. 

<div class="floatleft caption">

  <p>A me out in the wild, snappin' photos.</a></p>
</div>

Sure, I'm still going to have to do commission work to stay afloat. And sure, if a sequential art job comes across my desk and it's a project I find myself interested in, I might just take it. I need to eat, after all. But I need an outlet for *myself*, and if I'm going to have one I need to force myself to make time for that outlet. 

This is my job, but I want to make time to draw and paint for myself as well, and as of this winter I've decided to make a point to do so. The painting I've been working on that you see here is still in progress, and I don't know when it will be done, but I should have a photo roll up at some point showcasing its progress. 

To be frank, I don't expect to have this loose of a process for every single painting in the future, or even any of them for that matter. I had this canvas gessoed and sitting on my easel for over a year at the point where I finally got tired of looking at it and just put some lines on it from a preliminary sketch I had sitting around. It was rough, but it got paint on the canvas. In the future, though, I'd prefer to follow in the steps of the pre-raphaelites and plot out my every move *before* I set paint to the final canvas's surface and set forth into the final concept.

But the important part here is that *it was started*, and now I just have to keep it *going*. 

And finally...

### NAMES (THE BIG ONE)


<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/6_2.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/6_2.png" alt="A discord message from me on the datafruits server. it reads: hey so, kind of a big deal announcement: going by Piper now. no more Sarah. thank u in advance for your support. speaking of i should probably change the name of &quot;Sarah Allen Reed And The Jazz Program&quot; on the schedule at some point huh"/></span></p>
  <p>Informing the Datafruits fam over on Discord.</a></p>
</div>

I will probably write something longer over the course of the next few months about this, but I do want to get it out of the way now. Hell, you've probably noticed it already, seeing as every instance of my old name has been replaced with the one I'm going by now.

While the domain name sarahallenreed.com will probably still direct to my main site for a while until I properly set the redirect up to piperbly.com, I am no longer going by that name.

No longer going by my [dead mother's](/post/0022/#depression-isolation-and-family-or-a-lack-thereof-content-warning) last, no longer bothering taking a straight-ahead feminine name for the first. 

First and last from two muckrackers--one [fictional](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-lm&q=piper+oxhorn#), one [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bly)--and no-middle-name from a [fictional skull-cracking ramblin' man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Reacher).

Call me Piper, if you could. It suits me a bit better.

## WHAT'S NEXT

### SIX THREES FOR THE NEW YEAR

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/07.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/07.png" alt="A post on Mastodon, showing one of my &quot;six threes&quot; posts in the thread keeping me accountable on it."/></span></p>
  <p>I won't be putting the entire thread of daily progress on here--I only have so much server space, I'm afraid--but you can check it out <a href="https://sunny.garden/@sarahallenreed/111682613560402669">over on Mastodon.</a></p>
</div>

I usually can't be arsed for New Year's resolutions, but I did want to set one this year. The current goal is--unless i'm on deadline and absolutely cannot focus on anything else--to knock in at least 

* thirty three brush strokes on a canvas (or the equivalent thereof on a personal work)
* thirty three lines on a comic page or client piece   
* thirty three words on a manuscript or blog post   
 
every day that I can for the rest of the year. 

Thus far, I've had to take exactly one break from that--while I was moving my account over to [my current one at piper@sunny.garden](https://sunny.garden/@piper), I ended up on a dash to get the pages for Our Lady Maven done and out the door and lost track of time--but I've kept fairly tight to it. 

That doesn't mean I've not had bad days; even with the holidays over and done with, I'm still battling my mental. But trying to have a short goal of a word or brushstroke count that's hard to actually mentally keep track of tends to keep me moving far past the allocated count even on days when moving to the kitchen to make myself eat is a struggle.

### MORE POSTING, MORE OF THE TIME (HOPEFULLY)

Finally, as you probably noticed from the fact that one of those entries on the list involves writing...yup, I wanna be more active on here. 

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0022/08.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0022/08.jpg" alt="My writing desk, with the Smith-Corona PWP 3850 DS sitting on my workspace next to my monitor."/></span></p>
  <p>It's my new friend, Squashy!</a></p>
</div>

I started really leaning into [photo rolls](/tags/photo-roll/) at the end of last year, and I do in fact want to keep doing that. Having a small segment every month where I compile all my "scenes from the studio" posts [that I put up on Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@piper) back over here helps keep them all in one place, and it's nice to see a sense of progression in my own work looking back. 

Outside of that, though, I do want to think more deeply about the media I consume and put my thoughts on it all here more frequently than I have been, so I'm gonna try to keep up with [The Finer Things](/tags/the-finer-things/) posts more often this year. I also want to actually work on the cooking column a bit more, as well as do some write-ups on the retro tech I've been hacking around on. Hell, I recently acquired a new friend in the studio (shown here to the right) and I'm working on writing a blog post about how she works and why I love old word processors in general--and doing it [on the machine herself!](https://sunny.garden/@sarahallenreed/111665696804707074) 

I miss finding joy and fun in life instead of just pursuing rampant productivity for the sake of an audience, and I want to make more things about things I love rather than trying to make my work fit into a predetermined mold that was typecast for me by people who see the things I do and immediately slot them (and me) into a genre I don't fit into. This is a large part of that, and I hope you all are lookin' forward to what I've got cooking as much as I'm looking forward to making it.

---

That's about the (very) long and (not very) short of it! Sorry for the absence, and thank you as always for sticking with me. 

I know I said the next installment of The Finer Things would be here last time, and while I still intend to get that up soon the next thing that *will* actually go up is the February Talkie Time and Jazz Program schedule and a few more photo rolls. I still haven't forgotten about the Dirty Harry retrospective rewatch, though, and rest assured I Sure Do Have Some Complaints About It that you'll all get to read soon.

Thank you all, as always, for being here, friends. You're all amazing and don't let anyone tell you that you're not. See you soon.

--Piper

[^1]: And yes, of course that acronym is [another theology/religious studies pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lwa). What, did you expect it *not* to be? This is *me* we're talking about here.

[^2]: Currently, there's three sorting folders for the research--a "to read" section with the docs that I've sourced but haven't read yet, a "read" section for docs I need to add notes to and move on to the final folder, and the "notes taken" folder that I have notes filed away in the zettelkasten for. The "to read" section gets larger with every passing day...

[^3]: Also, Die Hard is not *just* a Christmas Movie. It's good enough to be a Once A Month or Otherwise Regularly Watched Movie. With that stated, playing Snatcher on Christmas is tradition for my dumb ass at this point, and by default that means it's a forced tradition for anyone I live with or spend time with on Christmas. Unfortunately for anyone reading, the continued popularity of the Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays marathon means that also happens to mean all of you. We'll be doing it next year too, by the way. Hope you like Neo Kobe pizza.

[^4]: To be frank, I might never feel comfortable doing so. A large part of why [I do not want to write autobio anymore](/post/0022/#barren--lilies-on-acheron) is because we live in a day and age where [trans people who work in the public eye](https://www.advocate.com/crime/zooey-zephyr), [trans entertainers](https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/swatted-transgender-woman-files-human-rights-complaint-against-london-police), [drag queens](https://www.businessinsider.com/drag-queen-twitch-streamers-swatting-livestreaming-2021-11) and a good amount of other visibly queer people are victims of SWATting just because they're trans and visibly so. <br/><br/>I bring this fact up because a *lot* of my mental health struggles have seen me wrestling with things that any particularly motivated asshole could start sending wellness checks to my house over if I make the mistake of talking about them in realtime on main. [I don't need more attack vectors and trauma in my life](https://theintercept.com/2020/08/22/police-shooting-wellness-check-sandy-guardiola/) if someone who doesn't understand what they were doing calls in a wellness check and ends up inadvertantly [calling a hit squad of cops to my house](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/police-shootings-mental-health-calls/)--or, for that matter, if someone who *does* understand full well what could happen decides to make a fake concern call to achieve a specific result.

[^5]: You could argue that this entire site constitutes a personal work; and to that I would call you pedantic, but kind of correct. I'm explicitly talking about *visual* works here--paintings, illustrations, that sort of thing. But yes, I did--at least in part--make this blog to get me back into the habit of actually writing again.
