Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of June of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

First, a bit of an interlude...

## JAZZ IS GOOD! AND STUFF!

A good portion of you probably know that, at one point, I found myself hosting an explicitly antifascist extreme & experimental radio program called "The Forest At Night". That program is long over now [(although you can still check out a good portion of the interviews online)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxDRmm6KlO7JyI6Wou3Xe1SayqWBxskIB) but what you may be surprised to know is that my love of extreme and experimental music comes mainly from my love of jazz.

How that came about is a topic for another post, but for now I want to introduce you to (and talk a bit about) three of my favorite extreme music records that either straddle the border on (or lay right on top of of) extreme music and jazz.

***Psyopus: Our Puzzling Encounters Considered***

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/01.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/01.jpg" alt="Cover art for Psyopus's &quot;Our Puzzling Encounters Considered&quot;"></a></p>
  <p></p>
</div>

One of my favorite avant-garde post-hardcore offshoots of the mid-2000s, Psyopus stands out from the crowd so hard that Metal Archives actually *removed them from their listings* for being too "out there" to reasonably slot into the label of "metal", a fact that has spawned [at least](https://forum.metal-archives.com/viewtopic.php?t=53946) three [separate](https://forum.metal-archives.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=53946&start=40) forum threads [on the band's removal](https://forum.metal-archives.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=57283&view=previous). That takes a *lot*, for the record-- hell, [even *I* somehow still have a page on Metal Archives](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Sarah_Allen_Reed/850153)[^1]--and quite frankly if their intentional removal from the Metal Archives for being "too strange" isn't a sign that you should check this band out, I don't know what is.

They've released three albums, with their second release "Our Puzzling Encounters Considered" being my personal favorite. If you're familiar with acts like The Dillinger Escape Plan, Car Bomb, and Botch, you'll be right at home. Psyopus plays a fascinating fusion of math metal and free jazz taken to an almost inhuman degree, spearheaded into oblivion by lead guitarist Christopher Arp. If you like your extreme music fast, furious, and ready to rip your fucking skull clean off your spinal column, Psyopus is a very easy recommend.

***Kayo Dot: Choirs Of The Eye***

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/02.png"><img src="/blog/0014/02.png" alt="Cover art for Kayo Dot's &quot;Choirs Of The Eye.&quot;"></a></p>
  <p></p>
</div>

Formed after the breakup of absolutely legendary avant-garde metal outfit [maudlin of the Well](https://kayodot.bandcamp.com/album/my-fruit-psychobells-a-seed-combustible) and featuring an orchestra worth of instrumentation, an insistence on [through-composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-composed_music) and a style so out of left field that John Zorn immediately picked it up for his first entry in [Tzadik Records' Composer Series](https://www.tzadik.com/)

The best way I can describe this record is "drowning", and I mean that in every single sense of the word. The opening music pull you under the waves, and the rest of the record keeps you in the eye of the maelstrom, filling your ears and your lungs with sound as Toby Driver and company give you a masterclass in grabbing the listener by the throat and pulling them under torrents of sound. If there's a record one could point to that laid the brickwork for a lot of the post-black metal of the late 2010s, it's this specific 2003 release.

***Moonchild Trio: Six Litanies For Heliogabalus***

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/03.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/03.jpg" alt="Cover art for Moonchild Trio's &quot;Six Litanies For Heliogabalus&quot;"></a></p>
  <p></p>
</div>

What, you genuinely thought I was going to make it through this list *without* mentioning a John Zorn project? We already name-dropped him once, and you're not getting out of this without me blabbing your ear off about the 90's New York jazz scene's DaVinci-on-acid.

Calling the Moonchild trio a "supergroup" is not a stretch in the slightest. The band sports Joey Baron (of Masada and nearly all of the Masada variants and side projects) on drums, Mike Patton (yes, *that* Mike Patton--of Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Lovage, and many, many other records and project) on vocals, and Trevor Dunn (most notably from Secret Chiefs 3 and Mr. Bungle), with John Zorn himself composing the music and conducting. This album isn't exactly their most approachable--in fairness, none of them are particularly easy to swallow, but seeing as the lead vocalist runs Ipecac Records that's to be expected--but it is the only one that includes guest musicians, and the guest lineup is a *doozy*. Three particular highlights of note are Ikue Mori helming the electronics, Jamie Saft going ham on the organ, and John Zorn himself taking his alto sax out for a spin.

Be sure to sit down if you put this record on--the record starts on full bore with Patton jumping down your throat the second the needle hits the vinyl, and it doesn't let up from there.

If you like jazz but have never dipped your toes into extreme and experimental music, these three records are fantastic starting points. With all that said, let's get into this month's lineup...

## June 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule

### July 4, 2023 

#### Talkie Time: Counterspy - Postal Pirates, parts 1 & 2

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKysErG4hA"><img src="/blog/0014/04.jpg" alt="Cover art for Moonchild Trio's &quot;Six Litanies For Heliogabalus&quot;"></a></p>
  <p><a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKysErG4hA">aRRrR its tHe pIrATEs theY SteALin Me MaIiIIlL</a></p>
</div>

Airing on the NBC Blue Network from 1942 to 1957, Counterspy stars Don MacLaughlin as David Harding, the head of the United States Counterspies--spies whose job it was to catch and fuck up other spies. If that sounds like it goes hard right out of the box, you'd be right--there aren't many radio programs that can boast about an over-fifteen-year runtime. In fact, it literally exists because *another* program went *even harder*-according to Hal Erickson's ["From Radio To The Big Screen"](https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/from-radio-to-the-big-screen/), Phillip H. Lord, writer of Gang Busters, wrote the pitch to the program after getting in hot water with J. Edgar Hoover himself over some Gang Busters scripts.

And speaking of radio and big screens, Counterspy almost made it to the small screen in 1958--a television pilot was filmed, but never sold. Thankfully, the [Internet Archive has it](https://archive.org/details/counterspy), and it's absolutely worth a watch. You can check that out another night, though--tonight, we're listening to episodes 1 and 2 of "Postal Pirates", which originally aired on September 20 and 22 in 1949, respectively.

#### The Jazz Program LISTENER REQUEST NIGHT: Einariii's Space Lounge Special

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/05.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/05.jpg" alt="Cover art for Moonchild Trio's &quot;Six Litanies For Heliogabalus&quot;"></a></p>
  <p><a href= "https://richardcheese.com/index.html">No, we're not playing this guy.</a> What do you think this is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdVoFKGlBLA">Space Quest?</a></p>

         pass the time but that's a simulation too
      [10:36 PM]it's all  fake everything is fake
      [10:36 PM]but the journey is real
      [10:36 PM]they are moving throughout

### July 11, 2023 

#### Talkie Time : Dick Lawrence Review - Grandfather's Stories

We're diving back into the legendary back catalogue of WNIB's finest tonight. A couple months ago, we [checked out the episode 'Lost Pilot Of A Lost Age'](/post/0010/#talkie-time--dick-lawrence-review---lost-pilot-of-a-lost-age), and while I still haven't managed to track down much in the way of either information on the man himself or tapes of his program, I'd be remiss if I didn't keep broadcasting the tapes I *can* track down. 

Just like last time, I don't have much in the way of metadata and broadcast dates here for you, but I do have another tape. We'll be listening to “Grandfather's Stories” tonight.

And if you at home have any info on (or, even better, show recordings of) The Dick Lawrence Review, PLEASE reach out. My email, as always, is [sarah@sarahallenreed.com](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed). If you've got old tapes from the man lying around, I'd absolutely love to hear them and share them with my audience, so please send them my way.

#### The Jazz Program: Chihiro Yamanaka - Monk Studies / When October Goes / After Hours

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/06.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/06.jpg" alt="Cover art for Chihiro Yamanaka's &quot;Forever Begins&quot;"></a></p>
  <p>We're not playing this one tonight, but you should still give it a listen anyways.</p>
</div>

If you've taken the time to check out [the listening list](/post/misc_listen) in the new batch of site updates, you may have spotted a recurring name on the list there.[^2] The fact of the matter is, I've been absolutely OBSESSED with Japanese jazz pianist Chihiro Yamanaka's work as of late. 

Apparently I'm not the only one to be struck by her keywork--her 2011 Umbria Jazz Festival performance had one reviewer describe her piano work as ["a bit like Mulgrew Miller on classically trained steroids"](https://jazztimes.com/reviews/live/umbria-jazz-2011/). I'd say that's an accurate assessment of her skills, and I'm more than stoked to share these records with all of you tonight.

We'll be taking a listen to three records of hers; namely, 2017's "Monk Studies", 2002's "When October Goes", and 2008's "After Hours". You know it's going to be a good set of records when even *I* can't get them out of my head. Tune in--you're in for a treat.

### July 18, 2023 

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/07.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/07.jpg" alt="Cover art for Chihiro Yamanaka's &quot;Forever Begins&quot;"></a></p>
  <p>yeah man I don't even have a joke to go along with this cover art. Anyways <a href="https://archive.org/details/BlueBeetle0211955">you can read the original Golden Age comics on the Internet Archive</a> if that's something you're into..</p>
</div>

#### Talkie Time : The Blue Beetle - Smashing The Arson Ring / Blasting The Dynamite Ring

Hey, we can't always be listening to crime dramas. Sometimes we gotta take a break, and listen to dramas about dudes in long underwear putting on masks and solving crime with funny names. That's slightly different, right?

<sup>...yes it is, shut up</sup>

Voiced by the legendary Frank Lovejoy for the first 13 episodes and an uncredited actor in the last few episodes, The Blue Beetle serializes and dramatizes the exploits of the [Fox Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Feature_Syndicate) comic character of the same name. Our boy Dan Garret[^3] will be slipping on that light-as-silk-but-stronger-than-steel slinky blue catsuit and popping a few pills worth of Vitamin 2X before heading out to wrestle big strong bad men into submission in two episodes this evening. 

If you think that sounds a little gay, you're right. This is the Golden Age of comics we're talking about here, son. Everyone's a little freaky, and here on Talkie Time we're all about that gay shit. We'll be listening to Frank Lovejoy telling us the tales of how he spent his evenings Blasting The Dynamite Ring (originally aired May 24, 1940) and Smashing The Arson Ring (originally aired June 21, 1940). 

#### The Jazz Program Gives You A TAG TEAM TABLES MATCH: Bill Evans and Jim Hall's "Undercurrent" / Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster's "Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster" / Antônio Carlos Jobim and Frank Sinatra's "Sinatra–Jobim Sessions"

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/08.gif"><img src="/blog/0014/08.gif" alt="The Dudley Boys put a sucka through a table."></a></p>
  <p> speaking of men in tight outfits hugging it out... </p>
</div>

This one's about as straightforward as you're going to get as far as theme nights go--three albums worth of tag-teams of heavy hitters, back to back to back. You may note we've played at least one of these albums already--last year while I was experimenting with the "artist spotlight" format we do on a weekly basis these days, I ran an episode on Bill Evans and played Undertow as the closer. 

It's one of my favorite albums, however, and so we're playing it again, along with the 1957 release "Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster" and the alternate-take collection of the absolutely legendary 1967 release "Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim"[^4], 1979's "Sinatra-Jobim Sessions". 

I had even more veritable team-ups to pick from, but for now, we'll stick to these three. Keep an eye out though; [you never know when I'm gonna hit you with the 3D.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9WjLrR-hss)

### July 25, 2023 

#### Talkie Time: _Cloak And Dagger Night_ - The Secret Box / Swastika On The Windmill

Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain's 1946 book "Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS", Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I've inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it's absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren't currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work. 

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0014/09.jpg"><img src="/blog/0014/09.jpg" alt="Cover art to Crime Jazz Volume 4."></a></p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQmpjFmB9yg">&quot;We're gonna do, like, at <strong>least</strong> five separate crimes with just these martini glasses. Just you wait.&quot;</a> </p>
</div>

While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven't exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s--see also half of James Bond's catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it's still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.

This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and we'll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month's edition--namely, "The Secret Box" and "Swastika On The Windmill", which aired on July 23 and July 30, respectively, in 1950.

#### The Jazz Program Presents _CRIME JAZZ NIGHT!_ : Crime Jazz Volume 1, Disks 5 & 6

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don't know, we'll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We'll be spinning both disks 5 and 6, letting them play long into the night. Tune in.

----

That's the show lineup for this month! I'll be back soon with a Studio Update--it'll be a big one--as well as that new column I talked about last post.

Have a good one.

Footnotes...

[^1]: I genuinely don't remember on what point specifically I was added to Metal Archives on, but I'm fairly sure it was my guest vocal spot on Adzes' ["No One Wants To Speak About It"](https://adzes.bandcamp.com/album/no-one-wants-to-speak-about-it).

[^2]: If Chihiro Yamanaka's name didn't stick out to you, a specific Ben Webster record might have; [we're also playing him this month](/post/0014/#the-jazz-program-gives-you-a-tag-team-tables-match-bill-evans-and-jim-halls-undercurrent--coleman-hawkins-and-ben-websters-coleman-hawkins-encounters-ben-webster--antônio-carlos-jobim-and-frank-sinatras-sinatrajobim-sessions).
 
[^3]: If the Blue Beetle you know isn't named Dan Garret, that's perfectly normal, son. Happens to every man at least once. Also, there were like [three different Blue Beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Beetle) so there is that.

[^4]: If this record *also* looks familiar to you, it should; I also played it last year during the brief period where I was trying out the Artist Spotlight format. I've also repeatedly referred to it as "the closest humanity will get to a perfect record". It's probably in my top 5, if not occupying the top slot. Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim is a fucking fantastic record, and everyone should listen to it at least once.
