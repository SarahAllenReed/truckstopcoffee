  <p>the Heavenly Choir of The Jazz Program</p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of April of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

## April 2, 2024 -- SKANKIN' FOOLS DAY: It's Just Three Hours Of Ska. That's It, That's The Program.

<div class="floatright caption">

  <p>is it an april fools' joke if it's true?</p>
</div>

Good news: tonight's Tuesday, which means I'm on the air yet again on Datafruits with another installment of my weekly three-hour radio block, usually filled with cool jazz and crime radio plays.

Bad news: yesterday was April Fool's day, and some jokester seems to have stolen all my jazz records and old-time-radio tapes and replaced them with a bunch of ska albums for some reason.

...it's me, by the way. The jokester is me. 

I present to you the stupidest April Fools' show I've ever made: Skankin' Fools Day. In order, we've got The Slackers' "Self Medication", The Specials' "Guilty Till Proven Innocent", New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble's "Low Blow", Los Fabulosos Cadillacs "El Satanico Dr. Cadillac", Mighty Mighty Bosstones' "Let's Face It", and The English Beat's "What Is Beat?" on deck in that order.

Will we get to all of those in three hours? Probably not. Will we insist upon trying to do so anyways? Abso-skankin'-lutely. Tune in.

### Talkie Time : The Man Called X - The Silver Scarab / Worth Her Weight In Gold 

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/02_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/02_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Herbert Marshall, otherwise known as The Man Called X. Look at this suave, suave motherfucker.</p>
</div>

Last month saw the [last installment](fillthisinlater) of our monthly sequential listenthrough of [Cloak And Dagger](https://archive.org/details/OTRR_Certified_Cloak_and_Dagger), the 1950 radio play documenting the exploits of the brave OSS agents who took the fight and the tricks to the Nazi scum in the second world war. 

Now I'm not saying [I don't clearly have reasons to be on a spy kick all the time](https://ourladymaven.com), but I sure do love my spy thrillers, and just because our listenthrough of Cloak And Dagger is done with doesn't mean I don't have a shitton of other international men of mystery to share with you. 

On that note, "The Man Called X" is our Talkie Time selection this evening, starring British radio heartthrob Herbert Marshall as one Ken Thurston, a very mysterious man doing mysterious things for mysterious government agencies--the former of which is as suave and debonair as you'd think and the latter two of which being as questionably legal and/or moral as one might expect. 

What's not a mystery (or a violation of international law and treaty, for that matter) are the two shows we'll be playing this evening--namely, "The Silver Scarab", which originally aired June 19, 1947, and "Worth Her Weight In Gold", originally aired on September 5, 1948.

### The Jazz Program : Miles Davis And Marcus Miller - Tutu (1986) / Music From Siesta (1987) / Amandla (1989)

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/02_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/02_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>One of the most fascinating jazz records of the 1980s, period--hell, part of me wants to use its release in 1989 and subsequent Sony reissue in 1991 to state that it's also one of the most fascinating jazz records of the '90s as well.</p>
</div>

There are those in the jazz world that insist that Miles Davis stopped making good records at some point--either sometime after 1959 after the release of "Kind Of Blue", or at some point in the 1970s with the line of demarcation being drawn either around 1970's "Bitches Brew" or 1974's "Big Fun"--and that anything he touched after that doesn't exist. 

To put it politely, these individuals should not be taken seriously, and we've got three of his last ever records--all three collaborations with Marcus Miller--to prove that point tonight.

Davis needs no introduction even to the average layperson, but Miller might. If the name sounds vaguely familiar, though, that's because it has popped up in the liner notes on albums by Luther Vandross (the vast majority of whose albums he co-produced and arranged) to David Sanborn (whose work [we've featured on the show before]()), as well as the three Davis albums we'll feature tonight. 

In order, we've got 1986's "Tutu", 1987's "Music From Siesta" -- whose collaboration was so explicit that the [cover art features both Davis' and Miller's names](https://www.discogs.com/master/62250-Miles-Davis-Marcus-Miller-Music-From-Siesta) and 1989's absolutely gorgeous "Amandla".

I do want to point out that these aren't my *favorite* of Davis' final works before his passing--that honor goes to the experimental, highly technical, and utterly fascinating final release "Aura", released in 1989. While we won't be playing that tonight, we will be playing it at some point, and between then and now I urge you to go track it down and give it a listen. It may not be the straight-ahead jazz or electric styles of early career Miles, but that doesn't make it any less incredible.

### Talkie Time : Pat Novak, For Hire - Rita Malloy / Wendy Morris 
<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/03_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/03_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>&quot;ey pal, the sign sais anythin' BUT moidah. you just can't be out here doin no MOIDAHS&quot; --pat novak, probably</p>
</div>

He's not real sure how he got into this mess. He's barely sure where he is right now. But he's got a boat to rent you, and that's what matters. Just please, for the love of god, try not to use it to haul a dead body wrapped in plastic halfway to [Nessie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness#Monster) doorstep? He's already had to deal with that twice this week, and he's tired of explaining to Inspector Hellman why his boat doesn't smell like dead fish as much as it does dead person.

With Jack Webb -- yes, Mister Friday From Dragnet himself -- in the titular role, Pat Novak is a down on his luck boat-hire guy who just cannot for the life of him find himself *not* in trouble with the law, often by either complete coy-inky-dink or because he needed the money and nobody bothered telling him what the money they're paying him was *for*. 

We've got two episodes of radio's most prolific patsy for you this week--namely, "Rita Malloy", originally aired April 23, 1949, and "Watch Wendy Morris", which originally aired the following week on April 30, 1949.

### The Jazz Program : Teru Sakamoto Trio - Let's Play Jazz Piano, Vol. 1-4

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0025/03_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Only pic I could find of the lads, ripped <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/2581059-Teru-Sakamoto-Trio">straight from Discogs</a>.</p>
</div>

Born in 1949 in Echizen--["the city of artisans", according to japan-guide.com](https://www.japan-guide.com/ad/echizen-city/)--in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, Teru Sakamoto is one of the better-kept secrets in the rare grooves of Japanese piano jazz. 

I could only track down a tiny bit of biographical information for this fantastic pianist or his two side projects, the Teru Sakamoto Trio and the Terry Herman Trio--hell, [even Last.fm comes up short](https://www.last.fm/music/Terry+Herman+Trio/+wiki)--but what I do have is four utterly fantastic disks worth of cool piano jazz for your spring evening.

The series "Let's Play Jazz Piano" was released on four disks by the fine folks at Victor in 1977 and 1978, and every single track on here is a hidden gem. If you enjoy your piano soft and full of life with a bit of spring in its step--pun only partially intended--you're in for a treat tonight.
