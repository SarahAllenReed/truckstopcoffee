Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of April of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

  <p>you when you hear that some people don't listen to The Jazz Program every Tuesday night at 9 PM CST on datafruits dot fm</a></p>
</div>

Last time, we had two theme months running simultaneously. We aren't doing that this month--mainly because I need a break from research[^1]-- but we do have some fantastic records regardless, including one artist that I'm shocked I haven't gotten around to featuring yet, a night dedicated to three of my favorite springtime records, and one of the final installments of both Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night.

(And don't worry, last-week-of-the-month-enjoyers; I've already got our next batch of monthlies picked out and ready to go. I don't wanna reveal too much, but I hope you like fancy outfits, because between the magical girls and the spandex we've got a lot of that coming up.)

So, whether you're spending your Tuesday nights out on the trail, hanging out with friends for a spring soiree, or alone in a dark room staring at a computer monitor (like me!), be sure to tune your digital dial to [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) and come join us on the air and in the chat. 

Now that we've got the intro out of the way...let's get into the schedule, shall we?

## April 2, 2024 -- SKANKIN' FOOLS DAY: It's Just Three Hours Of Ska. That's It, That's The Program.

  <p>is it an april fools' joke if it's true?</p>
</div>

Good news: tonight's Tuesday, which means I'm on the air yet again on Datafruits with another installment of my weekly three-hour radio block, usually filled with cool jazz and crime radio plays.

Bad news: yesterday was April Fool's day, and some jokester seems to have stolen all my jazz records and old-time-radio tapes and replaced them with a bunch of ska albums for some reason.

...it's me, by the way. The jokester is me. 

I present to you the stupidest April Fools' show I've ever made: Skankin' Fools Day. In order, we've got The Slackers' "Self Medication", The Specials' "Guilty Till Proven Innocent", New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble's "Low Blow", Los Fabulosos Cadillacs "El Satanico Dr. Cadillac", Mighty Mighty Bosstones' "Let's Face It", and The English Beat's "What Is Beat?" on deck in that order.

Will we get to all of those in three hours? Probably not. Will we insist upon trying to do so anyways? Abso-skankin'-lutely. Tune in.
