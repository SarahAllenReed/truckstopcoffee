  <p> First up: my third favorite Yes record, 90125. </br><br/> I used to have this one (and Fragile, my second favorite Yes record) on cassette years back when i owned a shitty Toyota Corolla with a tape deck. I've been looking for a replacement copy ever since, and while this isn't exactly a cassette I'm glad to finally have it in the collection. </p>

  <p> Anyone who tunes into the program regularly enough knows that I love my piano virtuosos and I love my Japanese jazz. This is very clearly the best of both worlds. <br/><br/> This was my first time listening to Makoto Ozone's work, and the chord work on this album is PHENOMENAL. It's a good thing that I did enjoy it--you'll see why here in a bit.</p>

  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/17.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/17.jpg" alt="A protective sleeve that the record came in, advertising Capitol Records. It reads, albeit somewhat grandiosely for a simple paper sleeve: This Protective Envelope is another example of the care used by Capitol to bring you records in ideal condition for the finest sound reproduction. It keeps your record dust-free and helps guard the grooves against scratches and abrasion. To insert protective envelope into album jacket easily, &quot;spread&quot; jacket by pressing edge lightly against body."/></span></p>
  <p> Must be due to that CAPITOL RECORDS PROTECTIVE ENVELOPE! ✨ so fancy! ✨</a> </p>

  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/18.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/18.jpg" alt="A hand holding Makoto Ozone's &quot;After&quot;"/></span></p>
  <p> Next up: it sure is a good thing i liked that first Makoto Ozone record CUZ I BOUGHT TWO<br/><br/>We're now playing his 1986 release "After". Lil' less piano jazz, lot more jazz fusion. Not sure if i care for the change, but it's still a solid record </p>

<div class="floatcenter caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/19.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/19.jpg" alt="A hand holding the LP version of Charlie Byrd's &quot;The Great Byrd&quot;."/></span></p>
  <p> Next in the stack: Charlie Byrd's "The Great Byrd", which has Charlie Byrd covering--among other things--a track from the fuckin' Rosemary's Baby soundtrack for some reason. Wild shit. This one annoyingly seems to have a couple hairline scratches in it that i didn't notice when I picked it up, though. Side A's a bit of a rough listen. </p>

<div class="floatcenter caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/20.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/20.jpg" alt="A very braggadocious dust cover, which advertises the Benefits Of Records(tm). The whole bit of marketing copy is longer than the alt-text box, but here's some of the outdated marketing copy: &#13 THEY ALLOW SELECTIVITY OF SONGS AND TRACKS. With records it's easy to pick out the songs you want to play, or to play again a particular song or side. All you have to do is lift the tone armand place it where you want it. You can't do this as easily with anything but a phonograph record. &#13 THEY'RE CONVENIENT AND EASY TO HANDLE. With the long-playing record you get what you want to hear, when you want to hear it. Everybody's familiar with records, too. And you can go  anywhere with them because they're light and don't take up space. &#13 THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE, INFORMATIVE AND EASY TO STORE. Record albums are never out of place. Because of the aesthetic appeal of the jacket design, they're beautifully at home in any living room or library. They've also got important information on the backs about the artists, about the performances or about the program. And because they're flat and not bulky, you can store hundreds in a minimum of space and still see every title...  &#13 IF IT'S IN RECORDED FORM, YOU KNOW IT'LL BE AVAILABLE ON RECORDS. Everything's on long-playing records these days ... your favorite artists, shows, comedy, movie sound tracks, concerts, drama, documented history, educational material ...  you name it. This is not so with any other kind of recording."/></span></p>
  <p> The dust cover from that Charlie Byrd record, featuring a message from Columbia Records who really, really want you to know that records kick ass and you should spend all your money on them. </p>

  <p> Only three more left in the baggy! Next up, we've got yet another fun crooner record courtesy of the 99 cent bin: Al Martino's "Living A Lie"</p>
</div>
<div class="floatcenter caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/012/22.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/012/22.jpg" alt="The back cover of Sonny James'  &quot;You're The Only World I Know&quot;. A finger is pointing at the fifth track in the track listing, &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight&quot;."/></span></p>
  <p> I'm gonna be honest here, I mainly bought this to hear Al's version of "Are You Lonesome Tonight". I doubted it'd live up to my favorite take on the standard--Sonny James's version, from "You're The Only World I Know", pictured here--but now that I'm hearing it I love it. It's got a totally different feel from Sonny's version, but damn if it don't hit. </p>

  <p> Second to last one, and the last one from the 99 cent bin: Herb Alpert's "Rise", from 1979 and also apparently from the collection of someone named Rebecca

  <p> And finally: Schönherz And Scott's "One Night In Vienna", released on my beloved Windham Hill records. </br><br/>That's what i bought at the record store today! Thanks for following along with me (and Mister Pliskin) on this lil' journey. Hope you have a great night, and remember to support your local record store!
