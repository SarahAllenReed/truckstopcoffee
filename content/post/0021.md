## I: Me, You, And The Major Players Here

### Who is this for, and why are you writing it?

* Active moderation against racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia   
* Daily backups   
* At least one other person with emergency access to the server infrastructure   
* Commitment to give users at least 3 months of advance warning in case of shutting down
