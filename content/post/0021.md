Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of January of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

### Talkie Time: Casey, Crime Photographer - The Loaded Dice (09/04/1947) / The Tobacco Pouch (09/18/1947)

[I promised you all a full episode of our beloved Casey last month](/post/0020/#talkie-time-presents-the-holiday-shit-list--casey-crime-photographer---santa-claus-of-bum-boulevard--the-snowball), and we're starting the new year with me paying out on that. 

We've got two episodes of everyone's favorite flash-toting, trenchcoat-wearing, raging-alcoholic somehow-hasn't-been-arrested-for-being-a-weirdo-in-public-yet nutjob named Casey for you tonight, and despite what the names of these episodes would imply they don't see our boy having that great of a night.

We're starting out with "The Loaded Dice", which originally aired on September 4, 1947 and sees our boy Casey's professional gambler bud Steve getting framed for murder over some kind of misunderstanding involving such inconsequential details like "there's a dead body in Steve's apartment and the stiff owed Steve money". Y'know, stuff like that. Happens every day. Nothing to see.

Next up, we've got "The Tobacco Pouch", which aired two weeks later on September 18, 1947. Ann Williams wants to go do some shopping, and Casey has a run-in with a kleptomaniac and then gets straight-up abducted just to get out of boyfriend-pack-mule duties. 

If you're wondering why I love this particular radio program so much, it's because of dumb shit like this. Don't just take my word for it, though--come tune in and hear the magnificent dumb shit Casey gets up to for yourself.

### The Jazz Program Croons For The New Year: Sonny James' "You're The Only World I Know" (1967) / Dean Martin's "For The Good Times" (1971) / Tony Perkins' "On A Rainy Afternoon" (1958) / Al Martino's "I Think I'll Go Somewhere And Cry Myself To Sleep" (1966)

  <p>Look, I know I've conditioned you all to expect shitposts here, and I know this looks like I'm doing a <a href="https://paperback-paradise.com/">Paperback Paradise</a>-esque shop job here. But no. No, this is the actual cover art. I'm not even fucking with you guys this time-- <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/3100354-Al-Martino-Think-Ill-Go-Somewhere-And-Cry-Myself-To-Sleep">seriously, here's the Discogs page.</a> There's nothing I can do to make this any funnier.</a></p>
</div>

2023 is dead and in the books, and it's time to dust ourselves off and prepare to stagger through yet another trip around the sun, and then another and another until Gojira comes back from the depths to mete out upon our wreched cities the kind of decimation and god-wrath which our insolent existence truly deserves.

I'd introduce tonight's lineup with something along the lines of "to celebrate" or "to commemorate" or whatever here, but let's be honest, we're all still hung over. Hell, I'm a year sober now, and *I'm* hung over from the bullshit that was 2016 Part Eight. So no loud noises and no boisterous bullshit tonight; just cool, goofy crooners singing cool, sad songs with their goofy faces until I pass out at midnight.

We're starting it out with a record I've been talking about a lot lately; Sonny James' 1964 sad-country-crooner masterstroke, "You're The Only World I Know". Next up, we've got a bit of a perk-up, with Dino's 1971 record "For The Good Times", and then Perkins here brings us right back down with his 1958 RCA release of "On A Rainy Afternoon." 

And, finally, we've got Al Martino in the corner making "guess-who-farted" faces about how I've spent most nights ever since CERN [turned on the Large Hadron Collider, sent us into the Bad Timeline, and fucked us all over](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cern-portal-to-another-dimension). Weird as the cover may be, his 1966's "Think I'll Go Somewhere And Cry Myself To Sleep" will close us out for the evening. Come join us, and remember to chant your yearly _ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn_ to help us bring in the new year. It may not keep Gojira at bay, but it'll at least calm Cthulhu's ass down and we gotta hedge our bets where we can.

### Talkie Time: Murder by Experts - Prescription For Murder / Two Can Die As Cheaply As One

Hosted by Robert Author and David Kogan --best known for creating the Mysterious Traveler seen here[^1], which....***oh buddy, that's a series we'll get to eventually***--

### The Jazz Program: Pat Martino - Interchange (1994) / Nightwings (1996)/ The Return (1987)

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0021/02_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0021/02_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Let's face it--neither you nor I will never be as cool as Pat Martino. There are just some things we all will have to live with.</p>
</div>

One of the most legendary guitarists to ever hold the instrument, the late Pat Martino should need no introduction. He entered the jazz scene in the late late 1960s with "El Hombre", and proceeding to continuously knock in virtuosic performance after virtuosic performance until a bout with amnesia due to an aneurism in 1980 [knocked his memories out from under him](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/music/2014/05/pat_martino_discusses_relearni.html). That didn't stop him, though, and he re-taught himself guitar and kept delivering fantastic records one after the other until his final album "Formidable" on High Note Records in 2017. Martino's work is captivating, inventive, and--if you've ever tried to play guitar at all--utterly mind-blowing. Sadly, Pat passed away in 2021, but his music still continues to blow the minds of jazz heads the world over. 

We've got three of his records from his time with the Muse label tonight, starting with his first performance back under his own group after relearning the guitar--and, it seems, re-discovering himself in the process--on 1987's masterpiece "The Return". We'll be following that up with 1994's "Interchange", and we'll finish up the evening with 1996's "Nightwings".

It should be noted that it took every ounce of restraint in me to *not* include one of my favorite soul-jazz records here--Bobby Pierce's "Introducing Bobby Pierce" from 1972 (or "Piercing, as the Muse re-release is known), which features Pat on guitar. We'll get to Bobby's orange-covered classic another time, though, don't worry.

  <p>hey man it's a good office policy to have, alright</a></p>
</div>


I'm gonna be honest, I've been playing an unholy amount of the Ace Attorney series as of late and I'm blaming that for this week's episode. Thanks, Mister Edgeworth. [^2]

Footnotes...

[^1]: You might notice that, usually, I usually try to track down newspaper, magazine, or other advertisements for each show on here for these little images. Thing is, I tried this for "Murder By Experts" but came up mostly empty handed.<br/><br/> I say "mostly", because while I *didn't* find any newspaper adverts for the show itself, I *did* found this while trying to track down one for &quot;Murder By Experts&quot; and it made me chuckle, So, in the interests of my own amusement, here's the [Man's Life](https://www.menspulpmags.com/category/mans-life-magazine/)-lookin' ass, [Weasels Ripped My Flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasels_Ripped_My_Flesh)&quot;-lookin' ass article from the November 13, 1938 issue of The Tennessean that I almost used for the preview image instead. <br/><br/><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0021/02_1sm.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0021/02_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span><br/>Look at it. Look at this nonsense. It's *glorious*.

[^2]: I'd be using a screenshot from Ace Attorney 1 here--this one is from [Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney_Investigations:_Miles_Edgeworth)--but as it turns out, [TWiLightMenu's](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases) screencap function only actually screencaps *whichever screen the DS considers to be &quot;active&quot; at the time*. So, the only shots I have of the dialogue in Ace Attorney 1 from an actual DS (well technically a hacked 3DS, but still) is just the play button on the bottom screen that they play during dialogue....soo you're getting the funniest line from the first case in AAI 1 instead.
