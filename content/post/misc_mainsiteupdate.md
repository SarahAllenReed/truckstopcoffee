## 2023

### November 11, 2023

* Added and changed the featured images on the Full Color Samples and Black And White Samples pages.
* Added an actually recent photo to the About page and cleaned up the design.
* Cleaned up the formatting on all text pages.

## To Do

* Add alt text to everywhere it's not already implemented. I want to make this site as screen-reader friendly as possible.
* Implement [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) to self-host my Git repos.
* Implement either [Faircamp](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp) or a netlabel-centered alternative.
* Fork [Rarebit](https://rarebit.neocities.org/), modify it to work with Hugo, and finally re-upload and self-host my old work.
* Impliment chapter table-of-contents for longer posts.
