Welcome to How To Cook Shit, a new segment here on the blog where I, for some reason, insist upon sharing some of my favorite recipes with you all. This is my website, though, so you're all going to have to make do.

I spent way too much time in professional kitchens in my twenties when I couldn't quite pay the bills with my work, and I've joked constantly about quitting comics forever and opening up a little diner if one of my books ever makes it anywhere near profitability. Kitchens are something I've always been among and around, and for me, cooking is a natural extension of my work as a storyteller. Nothing brings people together to share stories like a good meal, after all.

Besides, [Ian Anderson once hosted a guide to Indian food on jethrotull.com.](https://web.archive.org/web/20040404121530/http://www.jethrotull.com/musicians/iananderson/indian.html) There's a precident for artists making you read recipes if you visit their websites; and following from that point, if there's a good of a start as any, it's to follow the dancing flautist.

  <p> HEEEAAAAYYYY AQUALUUUNG </p>

(Oh, and before I forget, shoutout to [Einariii](https://einariii.xyz/) for beta testing this recipe for me! He says it's good. I promise.)

## The Dish

<div class="floatcenter caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0013/02.jpg"><img src="/blog/0013/02.jpg" alt="The dish we're preparing tonight, Mama Sarah's Hick-ass Vegan Saag Paneer."></a></p>

  <p> Tasty tasty tofu, <a href="https://youtu.be/VdO_X9T8OYY?t=506">none of which I've licked</a> </p>
</div>

This particular recipe is completely vegan, filled with spinach and other yummy greeny bois, and passes the Leftovers Test[^1] exceedingly well. I've enjoyed this fresh out the pan over rice, then heated some up the next morning with my breakfast falafel [^2], then slapped some over some sweet potatoes and eggs (I am vegetarian, not vegan) for dinner, and on the next day with leftover rice. It's also very, very easy to batch-prep in large amounts, which adds to the appeal very well when I'm either on a deadline or having a bad mental health week and know I might not be able to make myself cook more than once for the week. 

All in all, it's fantastic and I hope you try it. If you do, [shoot me an email](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) and let me know what you thought of it, if there's any changes you made to my recipe (I might just add them in an addendum later on!) or if there's any recipes you want to see me tackle at some point!

## Disclaimer

While I am a former chef, and have based iterations of this recipe on works by actual chefs who know/are trained in the culinary styles of India and the adjacent regions, as well as other folk who know their shit, I am white as all shit, worked my way up to the title of "chef" from doing my time in kitchens and eventually getting a chef job instead of going to culinary school where I would have learned proper, and hail from the cultural wasteland of Missouri. This recipe is mainly made for my tastes as a vegetarian, and while it is fantastic (I might be biased) it is absolutely not authentic. I would not serve this to folk who know what Indian food is supposed to taste like if you want to impress either them or their nani.

### A Couple Easily Accessible Reference Points From Folks Who Know Their Shit

[Serious Eats' Creamy Vegan Saag Paneer](https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-vegan-saag-paneer-tofu-recipe) <-- A version of vegan saag panner by the closest thing we have to the reincarnation of Julia Child, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. I'm including his tofu marinade as an alternate version here, but I highly recommend you just go read his full recipe as well.

[Latif's Inspired's Saag Paneer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXlt_PZgYpo) <-- Latif's Inspired's take on (not vegan) saag paneer. Also fantastic, and a great glimpse as to how this would be made in a working authentic Indian restaurant's kitchen. If you want to compare notes, his ingredients list is in the description of the video.

[Sanjana Feast's Ultimate Saag Paneer Recipe](https://www.sanjanafeasts.co.uk/2019/06/the-ultimate-saag-paneer-recipe-indian-vegetarian-curry/) <-- Sanjana's recipe is not only fantastic, but also sports a brief history of saag paneer, its place in Indian cuisine, and a low-down on why this recipe isn't actually called "saag paneer" but rather "palak paneer". I'm using the name "saag paneer" here for recognizability, but if you want to know why I'm wrong (and why everyone you know is, too), check out Sanjana's post.

## The Cookin'

  <p> we are getting there hold on</p>
</div>

#### Prep (day before)

Press tofu out and cut into cubes, like you would with regular paneer. Prepare a marinade of either:

**MY VERSION:**
* Nutritional yeast
* Black sesame oil
* Tumeric
* Black pepper
* Kosher salt

**KENJI'S VERSION** (again, [check out his version of this recipe if you haven't already](https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-vegan-saag-paneer-tofu-recipe))
* Miso paste
* Lemon juice
* Lemon zest
* Vegetable oil
* Salt
* Pepper

and toss the tofu in it. Put into a prep container and let marinate overnight.

#### Prep (day of)

*Worth noting that you could just do all this shit the previous day as well when you knock in the tofu. It should keep fine in the fridge*

Wash and rough chop two bags worth of spinach and send it through the food processor until neatly minced. Put in prep container and set aside.

Do the same to the california frozen veggies. You want those to almost be ground down to a powder, but not quite. Lil' veggie crumblies is what you're aiming at.

Finally, prepare the seasoning paste. Rough chop the onion down to size and put the following in the food processor:

* Onion
* Garlic (all of it)
* Ginger paste (as much as you can stand)
* Curry powder (~1 tbsp)
* Garam masala (~1 tbsp)
* Black pepper (~100 cranks of the grinder)
* Coriander (~1/2 tbsp)
* Chili paste (if you got it and want that extra KICK)

Basically, what you're doing is creating a seasoning paste that you'll toss right into the coconut oil to get it obnoxiously fragrant and immaculately flavorful. Add whatever else tickles your fancy, but I wouldn't put the herbs in there--just the spices--and I also wouldn't add the salt in just yet (the tofu marinade already has salt in it, and we'll toss in salt to taste later) (edited)

#### Cookin'

<div class="floatcenter caption">
  <p><a href="/blog/0013/05.jpg"><img src="/blog/0013/05.jpg" alt="Ainsley Harriott pouring oil into a pan."></a></p>
  <p>oh yeah it's oil time baby</p>
</div>

*Fry the tofu "paneer"*

Get your wok steaming hot (which is about a 6 or 7 on my shit-ass stove) and once it gets up to temp toss in roughly 3-4 tbsp of coconut oil.[^6] Let it melt out, then start frying up your tofu "paneer" along with the remainder of the marinade. You want it to get a little color on it, but not to brown completely. Let it roll about 3-4 minutes on each side, then give it a toss. Once it's gone for about 8-10 minutes, fish 'em out of the oil (but DO NOT DRAIN THE OIL) and set the lil' guys on a paper towel to drain, then toss in your next batch. Keep going till all the tofu's fried up.

*Get your seasoning paste in there*

Keep the temp high and toss in that seasoning paste we made earlier. The heat will damn near immediately activate the spices, garlic, ginger, and everything else, making your house smell like you died and went to Flavor Town. You wanna let that roll for about 1-2 minutes or until it gets **fragrant** fragrant, keeping it in motion by either stirring or gently tossing the wok so it doesn't burn. 

*Add your veg*

Once you got the house smelling utterly immaculate, add in your minced spinach and frozen veggies and IMMEDIATELY lower the heat at least a couple notches, to the midpoint of what your stove's capable of. Set a timer for about 5-7 minutes and keep those veggies moving. You absolutely don't want to burn them, and if you're using a wok they will if you keep them on the edges of the pan instead of rotating those flavors around. Once your veggies start to bubble and let loose nearly all of their liquid, you're good to emulsify.

*Emulsify the coconut cream*

Get your coconut cream out [^7], and slowly add a little at a time, stirring gently like you would to emulsify any other sauce. Once you have it all blended in,  add a bit more and keep stirring. Keep going till the whole can's gone, then add in your "paneer" and your bay leaves, lower the heat to about 4, and simmer for about 20 minutes, giving it a stir every 3-4 or so to make sure nothin' burns up or gets wonky. (edited)
[6:09 PM]You can add in herbs either once you've dropped in the whole can of coconut cream or midway through, or add them at the end. 

*Finishin' touches*

Once you've gotten it all simmered down, give 'er a taste. You can add more spices at this point if you like, and now's about when you'd want to toss in your herbs if you didn't do so midway through. Salt and pepper to taste, and serve over rice.

And that's the recipe! I genuinely hope y'all enjoyed this little diversion, because there's gonna be more of 'em. If you do end up making this recipe at home, [send me an email at sarah@sarahallenreed.com with your thoughts on it!](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) Enjoy, and I look forward to hearing from you all and seeing you all here next time, when I teach y'all how to make something a bit more in my wheelhouse--vegan buttermilk biscuits. Catch you later!

Footnotes...

[^1]: The Leftovers Test has exactly one requirement: if you keep it in the fridge for a week and nibble on it, reheating it in the microwave/stovetop/etc each time, is it edible for the whole week? And yes, this one very much is!

[^2]: That's coming up in a future installment, by the way.

[^3]: <s><span style="color: #777">I basically only use fresh garlic cloves for things like making garlic butter, pan sauces, and other things where having fresh garlic will make a textural/aromatic difference, because texture and aroma are the only two things that jarred garlic can't compete with if you just need minced garlic. Obviously, if you're doing things like roasting garlic, roasting peppers and onions, making a pan sauce, or something else where the texture or aroma will matter, get full cloves. But if you're just tossing it in a sauce or something, the convenience of canned minced garlic very much makes it worth it, especially for someone with ADHD and other various neurospiciness like yours truly. It will cut the aroma of the paste slightly, but quite frankly you're adding so many other amazing scents to the mix here and tossing them all *immediately* in hot oil so the difference will be negligable at best.</span></s> Turns out, I was wrong on this one for *years*. [Youtube cookery boy Ethan Chlebowski had a recent vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgES_Oj6-tQ) proving me wrong on this, and I tried one of his taste test experiments myself and...yeah. Turns out, real garlic cloves are superior to canned/jarred garlic in nearly every application, so I'll [eat crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_crow) on that'n. However, I will say that--despite what his vid states about it--if you still find yourself needing to not fuss around with the texture issues or hassle of garlic cloves due to various levels of neurospiciness and/or spoons, Asian supermarkets like H-Mart often sell pre-peeled garlic cloves in containers for around five bucks. Just make sure to use 'em *quick* quick, or they *will* go bad.

[^4]: Honestly, the main thing you need the food processor for is if you're using fresh spinach, and it can be bypassed by using frozen spinach instead. If fifty bucks for a decent food processor is a lot, then see if you can source either a mortar and pestle (which would be more traditional here) to grind the onion, garlic, ginger, and seasonings into the aforementioned paste, or just mince the onion and garlic as fine as humanly possible and mix all of the paste's required ingredients as thoroughly as possible in a bowl.

[^5]: If, for whatever reason, you doubt my white trash cred, I'd like to point out that I usually save and re-use my old Country Crock margarine containers for shit like this. Works great, don't gotta spend money on Tupperware or what-not. 10/10.

[^6]: I didn't include it in the ingredients list because this is a vegan recipe, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that traditionally one would use ghee for this. However, ghee and cocount oil have roughly the same smoke point, applications, etc. Only real difference is one is, well, butter and will give a more buttery/milky flavor and one is coconut oil and is vegan. 

[^7]: Similarly to the above, the substitute for the coconut milk is heavy cream or kefir, if you'd like to make a more milky vegetarian variant but still keep the tofu in. This one's much more of a purposeful omission than a vegan-friendly one, though, as I don't really know *why* you'd do that here.
