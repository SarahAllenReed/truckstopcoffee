The following are links to websites of folks I think are cool. 

Note that I said *websites*, not *accounts*. I don't want to use this page to promote social media networks, and the vast majority of folks (specifically, other cartoonists/DJs) who I know all have social media accounts in place of a website, so this list shouldn't be considered an exhaustive compendium of folks I think are neat. 

f you're not on this list but think you should be, I probably can't find your website or I haven't gotten around to adding you yet because I've been busy with other obligations. 

If you don't have a website, or you do and I haven't gotten to adding you yet, [bug me about it via email!](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com)

*Note: This list is VERY incomplete at the moment--I'm in the middle of a bunch of things and need time to track down a bunch of my friends' websites. I'm tossing it up as-is at this moment, though, and I'll be adding to it fairly constantly. Check back soon!*

## Good Folks

This part of the list is mainly folks I have personally known to some degree, and can (and often will) vouch for. 

### Fellow Cartoonists, Artists, And Pen Wielders

#### Joshua W. Cotter

Josh is more or less the closest I have to one single person I can credit/blame with setting me on this line of work. Hell, he literally gave me my first dip pen when I was a kid, and his style of writing and cartooning continue to both influence my own and blow my mind today. [Check out his work here.](https://www.joshuawcotter.com/)

#### Alex N. Graham

A fantastic illustrator, a stellar painter, and an all-around great human being. [Check her work out here.](https://alexngraham.com/)

#### Mel Sealy

I met Mel during a comix reading I did at Cafe Kerouac one year, and I've been a fan of her work ever since. [Check out her work here.](https://melsealy.com)

### Fellow DJs/Musicians/Netradio Stations

#### Freedrull

I could have honestly put Tony here under the &quot;Cartoonists&quot; or &quot;Hackers&quot; sections if I wanted--his work is fantastic--but he's most known for running [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm), my home on the airwaves for the past few years. [Check out his personal site here.](https://freedrull.online/)

#### Trash Panda QC

Trash Panda is another fellow Datafruit DJ and all-around good dude. [Check out his page here.](https://trashpandaqc.xyz/)

#### rbxbx

Another fellow Datafruit, a stellar human being and good friend, and the entire reason I own a Pinephone. [Check out their website here.](http://www.bleakbeat.com)

#### einariii / pipesines

A fantastic dude, very good friend, and brilliant hacker. [Check his website out here,](https://einariii.xyz/) and check out his program that turns raw code into an instrument (no I'm not kidding, it's fuckin' brilliant) [here.](https://pipesines.fly.dev/)

### Writers I've Worked With

#### Emily Crose

A good friend and frequent collaborator of mine. We worked on The Teletypist and are currently working on [Our Lady Maven](https://ourladymaven.com) together. [Check out her site here.](https://hexadecim8.com)

#### Cabbage

Another very good friend and collaborator, as well as a noted hater of puns for some reason I will never understand. [Check out their blog here.](https://kc-comics.com/)

## Folks I Think Are Cool

This part of the list consists of groups I think are doing neat shit, folks I look up to, and cool cats doin' cool shit in general. I don't know everyone on this list (although I do know and have known some of them), I just think they're neat.

### Knowledge Workers, Thinkers, And Smart Folks

#### Soren Bjornstad

A large part of why I picked Tiddlywiki to digitize my zettelkasten is because of this guy right here. [Check out the work that got me into his output here](https://groktiddlywiki.com) and [check out his blog here.](https://controlaltbackspace.org/)

#### Sadness

You literally can't have an old-school website at this point and *not* link Sadness's page. [Check out sadgrl.online here.](https://sadgrl.online/)

### Free Culture, Free Hardware, And General Hacky Shit

#### archive.org

Long live the Archive. [Support the Alexandria of the Web here.](https://archive.org/donate)

#### Jason Scott

If I have one goal in life, it is to be a single fraction as cool as Jason Motherfucking Scott. Archivist, hacker historian, and wearer of the dopest fits known to man, Jason is kind of a legend. [Check out his personal site here](http://www.cow.net/jason/), and [enjoy the magic that is textfiles.com here.](http://www.textfiles.com/)

#### Lars Windolf

The dude who made [Liferea](https://lzone.de/liferea) also has a killer hacker blog and a whole bunch of video tutorials, cheat sheets, and learning utilities available for free. [Go check him out here.](https://lzone.de/)

#### Leah Rowe / Minifree / Libreboot

I'm putting all of their joints into one entry, but you should check all of 'em cuz Leah is cool as shit. 

The Libreboot project needs no introduction for those of us in certain circles, but if you're unfamiliar, [go familiarize yourself](https://libreboot.org/) and then [support the project directly by snagging a laptop from Leah themselves.](https://minifree.org) They also have a [pretty dope personal website](https://vimuser.org/), and [made the absurdly optimized Lightbox implementation that i use here.](https://vimuser.org/1337box.html) Go check their work out.

#### Pine64

I have a Pinephone named Navi, and she's honestly my favorite gadget in my very gadget-filled purse. Affordable maker tech made by FOSS kids, for FOSS kids. [Check them out here.](https://www.pine64.org/)

#### Rusty Hodge / Soma.fm

If there is one singular influence on my taste in electronic music and me getting into DJing at all, Rusty's that influence. I've been listening to [Soma.fm](https://soma.fm) for almost as long as I've had Internet access, and I'll keep listening until they shut the servers down.

## Stuff To Read, Stuff To Watch

### My RSS Feed List

If you're curious as to what's in my RSS feed, [you can download an OPML file with what I'm reading these days here](/stuff/feedlist.opml), which you should be able to import directly into your own RSS feed reader. I personally use [Liferea.](https://lzone.de/liferea)

I'd note that my RSS feed list should be taken neither as a list of endorsements nor as a comprehensive list of cool blogs--I tend not to kick blogs off the list unless they pull some truly dumb shit or I just cannot see myself reading them anymore, but I sure as hell don't read a good portion of these. 

With that stated, here's some stuff I *do* think you should check out.

### Writing On Games

#### The Adventurer's Guild

One of the most genuine and funny websites for those of us who like our games obtuse, filled with [moon logic](http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Moon_logic_puzzle) and (very occasionally) [filled with very low-res FMV sequences featuring Minnesotans with English accents](https://advgamer.blogspot.com/2016/08/game-73-sherlock-holmes-consulting.html) or [terrorized by the grim spectre of Jim Walls](https://advgamer.blogspot.com/2022/10/blue-force-1993-introduction.html). Go read the Guild's journey through the years of adventure games [here.](https://advgamer.blogspot.com)

#### Virtual Moose / Michael Klamerus

Michael Klamerus is a pretty cool dude who has a pretty fun blog about gamedev, adventure game and adventure gaming culture, and other dope shit like that. [Go check out his Itch page here](https://michael-klamerus.itch.io/) for his games and a easy access point to the Michigan Game Dev Zone webring, [check out the collective he co-founded on Itch.io here](https://locallysourcedmi.itch.io/), and [go read Virtual Moose.](https://virtualmoose.org)


### Streamers And Let's Players

Unfortunately, Youtube has a fairly tight stranglehold on dumbass niche video content, to the point where you could eliminate two words from that four-word phrase by calling this specific type of bullshit "Youtube content".

I don't want to directly link to Google, and fortunately I don't have to. [Go install Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/) and then [import my subscriptions list](/stuff/ytsubs.db) if you want to check out some of my favorite video creators. 

In the meantime, here's a select list of folks I watch who *do* have their own web presences, and who I highly recommend you go support.

#### Kikoskia 

One of my absolute favorite Let's Players of all time, and an all-around good dude on top of that. [Thankfully he has a website so I don't have to link to Youtube; check it out here.](https://kikoskia.com/)

#### Julia Minamata 

Julia's not only an incredible illustrator in her own right, she's also a brilliant pixel artist and fantastic game designer. For the past while, she's been streaming her process as she works through the development process on her text adventure game, The Crimson Diamond. [You can check her out here.](https://www.juliaminamata.com/)

#### Supergreatfriend

I'm technically bending the rules here--[supergreatfriend.moe leads to SGF's Tumblr page, which doesn't count as a website](https://supergreatfriend.moe/)--but if you don't know who SGF is, you're missing out on one of the funniest video game crate diggers on earth. [If you watch nothing else this week, make it his Let's Play of Deadly Premonition](https://archive.org/details/LP_Deadly_Premonition/)--which, thankfully, is preserved on archive.org.
