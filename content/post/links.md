The following are links to websites of folks I think are cool. I don't want to use this page to promote social media networks, and the vast majority of folks (specifically, other cartoonists/DJs) I know have social media accounts in place of a website, so this list shouldn't be considered an exhaustive compendium of folks I think are neat. If you're not on this list but think you should be, I probably can't find your website or I haven't gotten around to adding you yet because I've been busy with other obligations. 

If you don't have a website, make one then [email me a link to it!](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com)


*Note: This list is VERY incomplete at the moment--I'm in the middle of a bunch of things and need time to track down a bunch of my friends' websites. I'm tossing it up as-is at this moment, though, and I'll be adding to it fairly constantly. Check back soon!*

## Other Cartoonists, Artists, And Pen Wielders

### Joshua W. Cotter

Josh is more or less the closest I have to one single person I can credit/blame with setting me on this line of work. Hell, he literally gave me my first dip pen when I was a kid, and his style of writing and cartooning continue to both influence my own and blow my mind today. [Check out his work here.](https://www.joshuawcotter.com/)

### Alex N. Graham

A fantastic illustrator, a stellar painter, and an all-around great human being. [Check her work out here.](https://alexngraham.com/)

### Mel Sealy

I met Mel during a comix reading I did at Cafe Kerouac one year, and I've been a fan of her work ever since. [Check out her work here.](https://melsealy.com)

### Cabbage

Another very good friend and collaborator, as well as a noted hater of puns for some reason I will never understand. [Check out their blog here.](https://kc-comics.com/)

## Other DJs/Musicians/Netradio Stations

### Freedrull

I could have honestly put Tony here under the &quot;Cartoonists&quot; or &quot;Hackers&quot; sections if I wanted--his work is fantastic--but he's most known for running [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm), my home on the airwaves for the past few years. [Check out his personal site here.](https://freedrull.online/)

### Trash Panda QC

Trash Panda is another fellow Datafruit DJ and all-around good dude. [Check out his page here.](https://trashpandaqc.xyz/)

### rbxbx

Another fellow Datafruit, a stellar human being and good friend, and the entire reason I own a Pinephone. [Check out their website here.](http://www.bleakbeat.com)

## Other Hackers/Tinkerers/Smart Folk

### Emily Crose

A good friend and frequent collaborator of mine. We worked on The Teletypist and are currently working on [Our Lady Maven](https://ourladymaven.com) together. [Check out her site here.](https://hexadecim8.com)

### Soren Bjornstad

A large part of why I picked Tiddlywiki to digitize my zettelkasten is because of this guy right here. [Check out the work that got me into his output here](https://groktiddlywiki.com) and [check out his blog here.](https://controlaltbackspace.org/)



## Shit I Think Is Cool

### Sadness

You literally can't have an old-school website at this point and *not* link Sadness's page. [Check out sadgrl.online here.](https://sadgrl.online/)

### archive.org

Long live the Archive. [Support the Alexandria of the Web here.](https://archive.org/donate)

### Pine64

I have a Pinephone named Navi, and she's honestly my favorite gadget in my very gadget-filled purse. Affordable maker tech made by FOSS kids, for FOSS kids. [Check them out here.](https://www.pine64.org/)
