Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of November of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

First, a bit of an interlude...

## JAZZ IS GOOD! AND STUFF!

If you like jazz but have never dipped your toes into extreme and experimental music, these three records are fantastic starting points. With all that said, let's get into this month's lineup...

## November 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule

### November 7, 2023 

#### Dice Roll Night!

It's the first Tuesday of the month again, and that means it's time for Listener Request Night on The Jazz Program yet again.

Unfortunately, we haven't had any mailbag requests in a bit, and I'm still working on the schedule and the site update so I also don't have much of a plan.

Sooo this week's request (and this week's episode of Talkie Time as well) comes courtesy of a die roll. We're picking three post-bop records and two radio dramas at random from my collection and giving them a spin.

#### Talkie Time : Richard Diamond - The White Cow Case / The Red Rose

  <p>no, Tex, not *that* statuette, wrong statuette. try and keep up man c'mon</a></p>

We've had enough of nail-biting [suspense](/post/0018/#october-31-2023----halloween-suspense-marathon) last month--it's time for something a little goofier. "A pleasant smile, a cheerful rhyme, and we'll keep you from doing time" is the tagline for our sharp-witted boy Richard Diamond, and we've got two of his cases for you tonight. 

Up first is "The White Cow Case", originally airing on January 11, 1962, in which our boy goes to find himself a rare art object called "The White Cow", which [sounds like something another detective I know got stuck doing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon). 

March 2nd, 1951's "The Red Rose" is up next, and while normally I give you all a plot summary I can do you one better this week, thanks to our good friends at [OTRR](https://www.otrr.org); those madlads tracked down and [digitized the original script for this episode!](https://www.otrr.org/FILES/Scripts_pdf/Richard_Diamond/Richard%20Diamond%2051-03-02%20The%20Red%20Rose.pdf) Go take a look when you can, and check out the rest of their script archives while you're at it--they've got a damn good selection of 'em over there.


#### The Jazz Program : SÃ©rgio Mendes And Friends - Cannonball's Bossa Nova / Eartha Kitt With Sergio Mendez And Brazil '66 / Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendez And Brazil '66

If there's one Brazillian jazz album I'd recommend that *doesn't* include Jobim or Gilberto in the lineup, it's Sergio Mendez and Brazil 66's debut self-titled record. Bearing the name of A&M's notorious co-founder (and next week's feature artist) Herb Alpert on both the cover art and the producer's slot on the liner notes (in what I imagine is an effort to move units after the runaway success of "Whipped Cream And Other Delights"), this self-titled blasted Mendes and company into the limelight and into the American jazz and easy-listening fan's radar. 

Thankfully, that isn't the last we ever heard in the states from this Brazilian powerhouse, and we'll be looking at two more of his records tonight--or, more specifically, two more of his collaborations. He isn't mentioned on the cover by name, but the 1962 classic Cannonball Adderly LP "Cannonball's Bossa Nova" does in fact have our boy on piano with the Bossa Rio Sextet Of Brazil that backs him up. We'll be starting the evening there, and following it up with a record that I can't find that much about but that absolutely deserves a slot on this program regardless--Eartha Kitt's "With Sergio Mendes & Brazil '66".
