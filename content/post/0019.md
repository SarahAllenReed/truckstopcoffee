  <p>IN A NOT TOO DISTANT HOLIDAY, NEXT THURSDAY AD!</a></p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of November of 2023.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

Oh, and before we start in--quick thanks to [Leah Rowe and 1337box](https://vimuser.org/1337box.html) for a fun new tool for visual gags. I shy away from using Javascript on this website (and in most things I do, to be honest), which meant that every image you clicked up until this point has just either loaded the full-size image and disrupted the flow of the article. The original [Lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) was pretty damn heavy on JS and pretty damn unoptimized as well. Thankfully, though, Leah's implementation lets me not only have Lightbox functionality here (click that old MST3K newspaper advert up there to see it in action!) but also lets me play some cool tricks.

I'll be backporting this all into previous articles hopefully before the end of the year, but in the meantime, click away on the images here! You might find something fun.

## November 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule

### November 7, 2023 -- Dice Roll Night!

To quote [the post I made on Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/111371756660213759) about this one:

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/01.gif" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/01.gif" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>calm down, pink bearded jesus.</a></p>
</div>

> *"It's the first Tuesday of the month again, and that means it's time for Listener Request Night on The Jazz Program yet again.*

> *Unfortunately, we haven't had any mailbag requests in a bit, and I'm still working on the schedule and the site update so I also don't have much of a plan.*

> *Sooo this week's request (and this week's episode of Talkie Time as well) comes courtesy of a die roll. We're picking three post-bop records and two radio dramas at random from my collection and giving them a spin."*

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/03.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/03.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>caught in 4k</a></p>
</div>

And, as it turns out, that's just what we did! 

Here was the program, as decided by The Almighty Dice[^1]:

***TALKIE TIME*** --   
* Night Beat : The Night Is A Weapon    
    (originally broadcast February 13, 1950)   
* Casey, Crime Photographer : The Red Raincoat     
    (originally broadcast August 29, 1946)   

***THE JAZZ PROGRAM*** --   
* Keith Jarrett : Changes   
    (released 1983)    
* Joe Henderson : Inner Urge    
    (released 1966)     
* Miles Davis : Dr. Jekyl    
    *(Cannonball Adderly Meets Miles Davis)*   
    (released 1993)    


I mention this down below in the footnotes, but we definitely will be doing this kind of thing again--half because I do want an excuse for the records I wouldn't ordinarily have a theme or spotlight for to see some play, and half because...well, we all know how shit I can be at planning sometime.

WITH THAT STATED, the first night of the week is *usually* reserved for all of your picks and suggestions, so get 'em in! Either [find me on Mastodon](https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed) and keep an eye out for me asking for Listener Request Night suggestions, [email me directly](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) or find me on the Datafruits discord server and let me know what you wanna hear!

#### Talkie Time : Richard Diamond - The White Cow Case / The Red Rose

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/02.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/02.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>no, Tex, not *that* statuette, wrong statuette. try and keep up man c'mon</a></p>
</div>

We've had enough of nail-biting [suspense](/post/0018/#october-31-2023----halloween-suspense-marathon) last month--it's time for something a little goofier. "A pleasant smile, a cheerful rhyme, and we'll keep you from doing time" is the tagline for our sharp-witted boy Richard Diamond, and we've got two of his cases for you tonight. 

Up first is "The White Cow Case", originally airing on January 11, 1962, in which our boy goes to find himself a rare art object called "The White Cow", which [sounds like something another detective I know got stuck doing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_a_Killing_Moon). 

March 2nd, 1951's "The Red Rose" is up next, and while normally I give you all a plot summary I can do you one better this week, thanks to our good friends at [OTRR](https://www.otrr.org); those madlads tracked down and [digitized the original script for this episode!](https://www.otrr.org/FILES/Scripts_pdf/Richard_Diamond/Richard%20Diamond%2051-03-02%20The%20Red%20Rose.pdf) Go take a look when you can, and check out the rest of their script archives while you're at it--they've got a damn good selection of 'em over there.


#### The Jazz Program : SÃ©rgio Mendes And Friends - Cannonball's Bossa Nova / Eartha Kitt With Sergio Mendez And Brazil '66 / Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendez And Brazil '66

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/03.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/03sm.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>One of the hardest band photos in existence. And yes, of course I own this one in meatspace. Click the image there and bask in its vinyly glory.</a></p>
</div>

If there's one Brazilian jazz album I'd recommend that *doesn't* include Jobim or Gilberto in the lineup, it's Sergio Mendez and Brazil 66's debut self-titled record. Bearing the name of A&M's notorious co-founder (and next week's feature artist) Herb Alpert on both the cover art and the producer's slot on the liner notes (in what I imagine is an effort to move units after the runaway success of "Whipped Cream And Other Delights"), this self-titled blasted Mendes and company into the limelight and into the American jazz and easy-listening fan's radar. 

Thankfully, that isn't the last we ever heard in the states from this Brazilian powerhouse, and we'll be looking at two more of his records tonight--or, more specifically, two more of his collaborations. He isn't mentioned on the cover by name, but the 1962 classic Cannonball Adderly LP "Cannonball's Bossa Nova" does in fact have our boy on piano with the Bossa Rio Sextet Of Brazil that backs him up. We'll be starting the evening there, and following it up with a record that I can't find that much about but that absolutely deserves a slot on this program regardless--Eartha Kitt's "With Sergio Mendes & Brazil '66"[^2].

### November 21, 2023 

Okay, look. I know I don't normally pop in and say something before I present each day's programming, but I want you all to know that I am unreasonably proud of how hard I went with this dumbass theme night here. 

Anyways, here's Thanksgiving dinner, courtesy of Mama Sarah.

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/05sm.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/05.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>Nothing makes Thanksgiving with the in-laws tolerable quite like having a good ol'-fashioned sesh with our boy Sam "Crack Pipe" Spade over here.<br/><br/>(And yes, I did go down a rabbit hole trying to figure out what that pipe is supposed to be--<a href="/post/0019/#fn:3">check the footnotes</a> for that one.) </p>
</div>

#### Talkie Time : Dinner's In The Oven! Sam Spade - "The Terrified Turkey Caper" / Casey, Crime Photographer - "After Turkey, The Bill"

For the record, I actually thought about spending this particular installment of Talkie Time on one of the many cookery-related programs in old time radio's history. There's a *lot* of 'em about, and [OTRCat has a great article about a few of 'em here.](https://www.otrcat.com/p/cooking-in-old-time-radio) 

The thing is, not many of them are *specifically* holiday-related, and while I fully intend to showcase a few of these before the year is up I wanted to keep with the Thanksgivingy theme I started in on.

So, for this evening, we've got two classic detectives talking turkey for you. First up is Sam Spade himself with his Incredible Normal Looking Pipe over there[^3], with "The Terrified Turkey Caper", releasing originally on November 24, 1950--which does, in fact, make this an actual Thanksgiving episode, as Thanksgiving Day was November 23 of that year.

Next up, we've got our boy Casey, Crime Photographer back at it again for the second time this month, catching those turkeys in 4k with "After Turkey, The Bill", which originally aired directly on Thanksgiving Day--November 27--in 1947.

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/04.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/04.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>We're using the term &quot;dessert&quot; very loosely here, you understand.<br/><br/>And yes, I <b>did</b> own this album on vinyl at one point, but sadly that was lost in my travels. It's very much on my To Find Again list.</p>
</div>

#### The Jazz Program : Dinner's On! Ray Bryant's "Hot Turkey" (1979) / Lee Morgan's "Cornbread" (1967) / Herb Alpert's "Whipped Cream And Other Delights" (1965)

Ding ding, motherfuckers! Dinner's up, it's on, and it's plate after plate of hot grooves on the turntables tonight. A juicy main course, a soulful carb to sop it all up, and some sweet, sweet desert--it's all here, baby.

First up, it's Philly-born pianist Ray Bryant's "Hot Turkey", a fantastic trio release from 1979 and featuring Major Holley on bass and Panama Francis on the kit. We'll follow that up with Lee Morgan's 1967 hard-bob belter "Cornbread", featuring Herbie Hancock on piano and Hank Mobley on sax to add even more of that bluesy, soulful flavor. Finally, we'll close it out with something sweeter--almost too sweet, some would say. Herb Alpert makes his second appearance on the write-up this month, with his seminal easy-listening Latin jazz record "Whipped Cream And Other Delights", released in 1965.

And, hey, if you're not full up on jazz after that...well, we've got something special on Thanksgiving Day just for you.

### November 23, 2023 THANKSGIVING DAY: JAZZY FUCKIN' HOLIDAYS, PART 1

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/photo/011/c8.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/photo/000/03.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>The poster for this year's incarnation of the Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays Charity Marathon. <a href="/post/photoroll11/">Go check out the process thread here</a>, or click the image itself to see the 2021 poster.</p>
</div>

It's the holiday season yet again, which means it's time for yet another installment of Jazzy Fuckin' Holidays. 

If you aren't familiar, every year on Thanksgiving and Christmas I do a twenty-four-hour long charity drive marathon for queer charities. I think this is our third(?) year running--Tony or Oven would remember better than I. Regardless, I've been doing these marathons every year for a while, doing my best to help those who--like me--don't have anywhere to go on the holidays feel a bit less alone.

Come tune in, as we keep you company through the holidays, spin jazz records to stave off the quiet, and help raise money for organizations that give an ear to those who might be having a difficult time during the holidays. We've got an active chat, and I'll be live on the microphones from when I wake up to when I pass out as well[^4], doing station bumps every half-hour and spinning tunes to keep you company.

And hey, even if you have somewhere to be, feel free to toss us on the air during your family gatherings! The playlist covers nearly every part of the smoother playlists you can usually find here on The Jazz Program, with quite a bit more smooth, post-bop, and vocal jazz and no free-jazz or avant-garde bumps. 

Plus, the playlist does not contain a *single* instance of a Christmas song at all--and yes, for my retail friends, *that does in fact include "All I Want For Christmas Is You."*. Not a single bit of Mariah Carrey or [Musak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak) christmas bullshit in the bunch.

Poster's free and it's printable, by the way. Drawn by yours truly. 300dpi, prints at 11x17. Print off a bunch and put 'em up all over town--and if you do, take a picture and tag me. [Download a .PDF of it here.](/stuff/jfc2023.pdf)

Look forward to seeing you there.

#### Talkie Time : Cloak And Dagger - War Of Words / Over Ground Railroad

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/07sm.png" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/07.png" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>CLOAK AAAAND DAGGERR!</p>
</div>

Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBainâs 1946 book âCloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSSâ, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while Iâve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and itâs absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who arenât currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.

While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes havenât exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80sâsee also half of James Bondâs catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, itâs still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.

This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and weâll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last monthâs editionânamely, âWar Of Wordsâ and âOver Ground Railroadâ, which aired on September 1 and 8 respectively in 1950.

<div class="floatleft caption">

  <p>those drum sticks are gonna commit SO many crimes and they're ALL gonna be cool as FUCK</p>
</div>

#### The Jazz Program CRIME JAZZ NIGHT - Volume 1, Disk 10: Brian Bennett In Action!

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you donât know, weâll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. 

Weâll be spinning the ninth release in Volume 1, featuring the fantastic compositional work of film and television composer Brian Bennett--which attentive British rock fans will recognize as the drummer of the Shadows. Thing is, he also had a helluva career in TV and film scoring, as well as a decent solo career which contains [one of my favorite weird funk/progressive/electronic fusions from the '70s](https://www.discogs.com/master/54371-Brian-Bennett-Voyage-A-Journey-Into-Discoid-Funk). 

It's the TV career we're focusing on this evening, and we've got a good amount of belters for you. Tune in. 

----

That's the show lineup for this month! Sorry for the absence--the holidays are always a bit rough, and with the move and everything else (along with some unexpected Fun Nonsense that I'll talk about in the next update) I've been a bit more behind than usual. Regardless, I'm here now, and I hope you enjoyed this little writeup as well as all the other [fun things](http://localhost:1313/post/misc_truckstopupdate/#november-17-2023) I've added with this recent update.

Stay safe out there, and I'll see you all soon.

Have a good one.

Footnotes...

[^1]: At the risk of spoiling the magic here, I just kind of picked a few from my folders at random before we went live. I don't have D100s here and I do have a massive record collection, so whenever we do this theme night again (which will prolly happen, as I sometimes am not the best at planning things) you'll have to pretend that there's actual dice rolls happening. I did borrow a bunch of Autumn's polyhedral dice, tho, and my radio desk is pretty noisy if you chuck stuff at it. So  we did have foley tools available to at least give the fun lil' illusion.

[^2]: I actually did a bit more research on this one, and as best I can tell it [seems to be a bootleg collection](https://musicbrainz.org/release/c35c5e04-9b7c-4f84-9e7d-fc8bd18b45e8). The only entry I can find of it, however, is on MusicBrainz, which...isn't usually something I use as a reliable research source, to say the least. <br/><br/>The fact that it *is* only on there, however, does kind of underscore that this is probably a bootleg--Musicbrainz primarily relies on user-submitted entries and doesn't require as much proof or have as much back-checking or (the important part!) insistence upon physical or label-verified releases as Discogs does, which lends credibility to this being an Internet-only bootleg compilation that ended up in enough people's collections to end up having its own ID3 tag submitted to MB.

[^3]: ...Okay, I debated putting this in-line, but it took up the whole textbox, so you're getting it here. <br/><br/><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0019/05deetsm.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0019/05deet.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span>
<br/> I had a helluva time trying to figure out what in God's name this pipe is. Damn thing looks like the artist tried making a straight-pipe version of a <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier">cavalier</a>, some very anglo-American variant/appropriation of a [ÄhaÅnÃºÅpa](https://spiritualitycircle.com/display-only/sacred-pipe), or a [midwakh](Midwakh) with an extended bowl (although that one specifically is fairly unlikely) but it just looks like something you'd pick up at a head shop, especially with that white stem there that almost looks like straight up glass. <br/><br/>I actually went on a small research tangent while writing this (because of course I did) to try and see if Howard Duff had any photos of him smoking this monstrosity that the artist might have used as a reference, but the only photos I could find of him with a pipe were a standard [straight billiard](https://pipedia.org/wiki/Billiard) or [Dublin](https://pipedia.org/wiki/Dublin). I almost gave up after hours of work...until, much to my annoyance, Autumn took one look at the advert and pointed out that the pipe had a brand name on the stem. "Dana."<br/><br/> Look man, sometimes my reading comprehension ain't that great. <br/><br/>So no, it's not a crack pipe, despite reeeally looking like one. It's a [DANA 31](https://pipedia.org/wiki/DANA_31), which apparently had quite a few [advertisements](https://pipedia.org/wiki/File:Dana_31.jpg) that paired it with a deal with Edgeworth tobacco, and [had other big names like composer David Rose](https://pipedia.org/wiki/File:Dana_31_dgeworth.JPG) backing it up.<br/><br/>I still think it looks like a god damned crack pipe, though. With that stated, Autumn cracked a joke about how &quot;it looks like it should come standard with an [FP-45 Liberator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP-45_Liberator) in your nazi killing care package&quot;, and to be honest that reeeally makes me wanna track one or two down for my collection.

[^4]: If you're curious--no, I don't usually stay up for the full 24. From when I go to sleep (usually around 0100) to when I wake up (around 0900/1000), I use [Mixxx's AutoDJ function](https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html#auto-dj) to keep the joint bumping. We'll still be taking donations for the charities and all that when I'm asleep, regardless, and if you need a friendly voice you'll more than likely find one in the Datafruits chat. So, if you happen to wake up earlier than I do, don't fret--we'll keep the jazz going for you, friend.
