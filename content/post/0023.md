  <p>FUCK YOU IT'S THE JAZZ PROGRAM!</p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of February of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

## FURTHER SUGGESTED LISTENING

It's February, which means it's Black History Month. This year, we're diving deep into the intersection of free jazz and Black liberation, exploring the lives and musicians that used the art form to explore what freedom meant and could mean for themselves and the black community. We don't often get to dive deep into the world of free jazz, but I'm definitely excited to do so this month.

I would be remiss, however, if I didn't do a short list of albums and artists I *wanted* to play this month but who either didn't fit the free jazz theme or whose lack of inclusion on this list ended up being a casualty of space limitations. Jazz may be America's only native musical export, but it very much was a Black creation and due to the creativity and ingenuity of many Black musicians. Here's three other records for you to check out this month, if you get the chance.

### Joe Henderson - In Pursuit Of Blackness / Black Is The Color

### Alice Coltrane - Ptah, the El Daoud

It's also Valentine's Day yet again also the first anniversary of these write-ups (although definitely not the first anniversary of The Jazz Program or Talkie Time) so we're celebrating that over on Talkie Time by playing some of my favorite programs in the history of Old Time Radio. 

I, however, can't look you in the eye and tell you I wrote the book, on daring dames in old time radio. That honor goes to [the legendary Jack French, whose article](https://otrsite.com/articles/artjf009.html) published in the February '96 issue of [SPERDVAC's Radiogram](https://www.sperdvac.com/) paved the way for his 2004 book "Private Eyelashes: Radio’s Lady Detectives". Jack sadly [passed away last year](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.obituaries/c/hec3IXh3Cqc?pli=1), but while this

  <p>I would put one of my usual <a href="https://truckstop.coffee/post/0016/#talkie-time--the-thirty-nine-steps-part-1-20013">&quot;no, not that one, go back&quot;</a> gags here, but I do want to quickly pay my respects to Yûko Takeuchi, who plays Sherlock in the 2018 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7755494/">run of Japan's &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot;</a> and who passed away in 2020. Seriously, go watch this show; it's great.</p>

### Talkie Time Presents Smart Dames For Valentine's Day, Part 1: Meet Miss Sherlock - Wilbur And The Widow / Case Of The Deadman's Chest

Not to be confused with [Miss Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Sherlock), Meet Miss Sherlock is a show I've had some kinda trouble tracking down information about. I could only find two episodes online--both courtesy of the [always fantastic Old Time Radio Downloads](https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/crime/meet-miss-sherlock) folks-- but the ones I could find are entertaining as all get out. 

Starring real-life radio newswoman Sondra Gair--who later went on to host interviews on Chicago's WBEZ-FM, because this is the radio business and all roads seem to lead to Chi-Town at some point or another--as one Jane Sherlock, Meet Miss Sherlock tells the story of Jane and her ditzy bimbo (and civil attourney) boyfriend Peter Blossom cracking crimes and solving cases. 

Both episodes I could track down are from the 1946 run of the program: "Case Of The Deadman's Chest", originally airing on July 7, 1946, and "Wilbur And The Widow", originally airing on September 12, 1946.

  <p>If I had to recommend another Ayler record for you to check out this month, it'd probably be 1964's &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;. The entire thing is a mind-melter of soulful, spiritual free jazz, and the only reason we didn't track this down tonight is because I wanted to save it for another feature later this year.</p>

### The Jazz Program Presents Three For Trane, Part 1: Albert Ayler - Live In Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse Recordings (1998)

Recorded in '66 and '67 on John Coltrane's *Impulse!* label and released in various forms throughout the years before finally ending up with the full slate of recorded material on one massive double-disk set in 1998, Albert Ayler's first full-length is first up on our spotlight of black avant-garde musicians for Black History Month, and it is an absolute peak moment in the history of avant-garde jazz as well as a high point of Impulse's entire catalogue. 

We've got the entirety of both sessions for you tonight courtesy of the 1998 release, and while we're very much going to go over our time slot tonight you're kidding yourself if you think I'm pulling the needle at midnight. 

This release is, in my opinion, absolutely essential, and you absolutely need to stick around to the very end. So come on, grab some coffee and stay up late with us--let's be honest here, what did you have to do tomorrow anyways? 

Oh, what, you have work? Pffft. Call in sick and listen to more jazz. Your soul will thank you.

That’s about it for this month! Thanks again for reading, and I genuinely hope you all tune in and join us. Next month is February, which--while it doesn't mark the first broadcast of The Jazz Program by a long shot--marks the first anniversary of me plotting out our programming in these writeups for all of you to enjoy.

Stay safe, and I’ll see you all soon.
