  <p>FUCK YOU IT'S THE JAZZ PROGRAM!</p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of February of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

## SOME THINGS TO READ WHILE YOU LISTEN

### It's Black History Month. Go Read These Books By Black Authors Instead Of Listening To My White Hick Ass

It's February, which means it's Black History Month. This year, we're diving deep into the intersection of free jazz and Black liberation,filtered through the lense of the output of  We don't often get to dive deep into the world of free jazz, but I'm definitely excited to do so this month.

I would be remiss, however, if I didn't do a short list of albums and artists I *wanted* to play this month but who either didn't fit the avant-garde/Impulse! records theme or whose lack of inclusion on this list ended up being a casualty of space limitations. Jazz may be America's only native musical export, but it very much was a Black creation and due to the creativity and ingenuity of many Black musicians. Here's three other records for you to check out this month, if you get the chance.

#### Bill Cole: *John Coltrane*

> "I’ve never approached playing [Asian instruments] in a traditional way; I express myself as a black person through the human vocal quality of non-tempered double reeds . . . There’s so much space between C and C#. I express what I’ve seen and experienced of racism and hatred against black people."   

>  -- Bill Cole, from "Bill Cole: African American Musician of the Asian Double Reeds" by Fred Ho,
>  published in *Afro Asia: Revolutionary Political and Cultural Connections between African Americans and Asian Americans*  

#### James Gordon Williams: *Crossing Bar Lines: The Politics And Practices Of Black Musical Space*

> "Improvisation by African American musicians is an articulation of Black humanity that happens within spaces and transforms those very spaces. Black musical space is ontological, imaginary as well as a reflection of social and cultural geography. Black musical space is rooted in the materiality of Black people’s lived experiences, a sociality with surprising permutations in what Patricia Hill Collins calls Black Civil Society."

> --James Gordon Williams, from *Crossing Bar Lines The Politics and Practices of Black Musical Space*

#### Gerald Horne: *Jazz And Justice: Racism And The Political Economy Of The Music*

> "Alert readers may have noticed that I have introduced the term 'jazz' with a bodyguard of quotation marks. This is meant to signify the contested employment of this term. Thus the master percussionist Max Roach did not embrace this word: 'I prefer to say,' he announced in 1972, 'that the music is the culture of African people who have been dispersed throughout North America.'”  

> Gerald Horne, from Chapter 1 of *Jazz And Justice: Racism And The Political Economy Of The Music*

#### Bonus: Philippe Carles & Jean-Louis Comolli (translated by Gregory Pierrot): *Free Jazz/Black Power*

It's also Valentine's Day yet again also the first anniversary of these write-ups (although definitely not the first anniversary of The Jazz Program or Talkie Time) so we're celebrating that over on Talkie Time by playing some of my favorite programs in the history of Old Time Radio. 

I, however, can't look you in the eye and tell you I wrote the book, on daring dames in old time radio. That honor goes to [the legendary Jack French, whose article](https://otrsite.com/articles/artjf009.html) published in the February '96 issue of [SPERDVAC's Radiogram](https://www.sperdvac.com/) paved the way for his 2004 book "Private Eyelashes: Radio’s Lady Detectives". Jack sadly [passed away last year](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.obituaries/c/hec3IXh3Cqc?pli=1), but while this

  <p>I would put one of my usual <a href="https://truckstop.coffee/post/0016/#talkie-time--the-thirty-nine-steps-part-1-20013">&quot;no, not that one, go back&quot;</a> gags here, but I do want to quickly pay my respects to Yûko Takeuchi, who plays Sherlock in the 2018 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7755494/">run of Japan's &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot;</a> and who passed away in 2020. Seriously, go watch this show; it's great.</p>
</div>

### Talkie Time Presents Smart Dames For Valentine's Day, Part 1: Meet Miss Sherlock - Wilbur And The Widow / Case Of The Deadman's Chest

Not to be confused with [Miss Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Sherlock), Meet Miss Sherlock is a show I've had some kinda trouble tracking down information about. I could only find two episodes online--both courtesy of the [always fantastic Old Time Radio Downloads](https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/crime/meet-miss-sherlock) folks-- but the ones I could find are entertaining as all get out. 

Starring real-life radio newswoman Sondra Gair--who later went on to host interviews on Chicago's WBEZ-FM, because this is the radio business and all roads seem to lead to Chi-Town at some point or another--as one Jane Sherlock, Meet Miss Sherlock tells the story of Jane and her ditzy bimbo (and civil attourney) boyfriend Peter Blossom cracking crimes and solving cases. 

Both episodes I could track down are from the 1946 run of the program: "Case Of The Deadman's Chest", originally airing on July 7, 1946, and "Wilbur And The Widow", originally airing on September 12, 1946.

  <p>If I had to recommend another Ayler record for you to check out this month, it'd probably be 1964's &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;. The entire thing is a mind-melter of soulful, spiritual free jazz, and the only reason we didn't track this down tonight is because I wanted to save it for another feature later this year.</p>
</div>

### The Jazz Program Presents Three For Trane, Part 1: Albert Ayler - Live In Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse Recordings (1998)

Recorded in '66 and '67 on John Coltrane's *Impulse!* label and released in various forms throughout the years before finally ending up with the full slate of recorded material on one massive double-disk set in 1998, Albert Ayler's first full-length is first up on our spotlight of black avant-garde musicians for Black History Month, and it is an absolute peak moment in the history of avant-garde jazz as well as a high point of Impulse's entire catalogue. 

We've got the entirety of both sessions for you tonight courtesy of the 1998 release, and while we're very much going to go over our time slot tonight you're kidding yourself if you think I'm pulling the needle at midnight. 

This release is, in my opinion, absolutely essential, and you absolutely need to stick around to the very end. So come on, grab some coffee and stay up late with us--let's be honest here, what did you have to do tomorrow anyways? 

Oh, what, you have work? Pffft. Call in sick and listen to more jazz. Your soul will thank you.

### Talkie Time: Defense Attorney - Client: Joseph Moriano (Audition Tape) / Client: Mike Tully

<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0023/02_1.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0023/02_1.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>No, I am not joking: this is a photo of the lady who went on to play one of the scariest voice acting roles in all of film.</p>
</div>

They say that being a lawyer is one helluva profession, so perhaps it's fitting that one of the most legendary lawyers in old time radio [also just happened to be the voice of the demon from 1973's *The Exorcist*.](https://travsd.wordpress.com/2022/03/16/mercedes-mccambridge-voice-on-loan-from-satan/)[^2] 

Mercedes McCambridge was more than just the terror of most '70s teenagers' dreams. Called "the greatest old time radio actress" by Orson Welles himself, Mercedes made appearances on *Abie's Irish Rose*, *I Love A Mystery*, *Lights Out*, *Inner Sanctum*, and more. 

Sadly, not too much survives from her fantastic role as one Defense Attorney Martha Ellis Bryant; [OTRCAT](https://www.otrcat.com/p/defense-attorney) only has twelve episodes available on their catalogue, and [OTRR](https://otrr.org/) doesn't have anything at all, as far as I can tell. It's a shame, because these are all fantastic examples of one of the most shining leading ladies in the history of radio dramas.

We've got two of those surviving episodes for you tonight, however: the pilot/audition episode "Client Joseph Moriano" -- which was recorded under the series' original working title, "The Defense Rests" -- recorded on April 17, 1951, and "Client: Mike Tully", which originally aired on August 31, 1951.

### The Jazz Program: Pharoah Sanders - Jewels Of Thought / Thembi / Black Unity

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0023/02_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0023/02_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>I would like to take this time to remind you--like every other jazz head you know probably has a million times at this point--to go listen to &quot;Promises&quot;, by Pharoah Sanders, Floating Points, and The London Symphony Orchestra. This was a "best of the year" release in 2021 for a LOT of us for a reason. </p>
</div>

Once described by Ornette Coleman as "probably the best tenor player in the world", Pharoah's releases for Impulse! are some of the most dynamic and interesting in the entire catalogue. And if you've been paying attention--or know anything about this month's featured label--you *know* that's saying something. 

Sanders found himself and his work on the label from 1969 to 1974, and in those five short years gave us eleven entire records, the vast majority of which were legendary and the rest of which were far beyond excellent. We'll be listening to three of those eleven tonight.

First up is 1970's "Jewels Of Thought", featuring what is one of the few--if not the only--recording of Pharoah playing the kalimba (if you know of any others, [email me](mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com) and let me know!). Next up, we've got 1971's "Thembi", which features another first with [Lonnie Liston Smith's first time on the Rhodes](http://www.jimnewsom.com/PFW2007/040307-LonnieListonSmith.html), according to an interview with Jim Newsom on Port Folio Weekly. And finally, we have another release from 1971, with the absolute monolith of avant-garde jazz (and showcase of Pan-African percussion) that is "Black Unity". 

Once again, if we go over time we go over time--you need to hear this record all the way through. And if you can't stay up all night with us...well, you've got homework. Go listen to these records, and then pick up ["Promises"](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/promises)-- Pharoah's 2021 collaboration with Floating Points with the London Symphony Orchestra playing backing band--while you're at it. There's a reason the jazz heads in your life haven't shut up about this record for the past three years.

According to [Paul Urbahns' fantastic piece written for the August 2007 issue of the MWOTRC's "Radio Recall"](http://www.mwotrc.com/rr2007_08/phylcoe.htm),

### Talkie Time:


### Talkie Time Presents CLOAK AND DAGGER NIGHT: The Last Mission / Delay On Route

Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain’s 1946 book “Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS”, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I’ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it’s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren’t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.

While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven’t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s–see also half of James Bond’s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it’s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.

This is our eleventh night in our listen-through of the full series, and we’ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month’s edition–namely, “Seeds Of Doubt” and “Operation Sellout, which aired on September 1 and 8 respectively in 1950.




### The Jazz Program Presents CRIME JAZZ NIGHT - Volume 1, Disk 12 - Tony Hatch In Action!

<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><img tabindex=1 src="/blog/0021/05_2.jpg" /><span class="f"><img src="/blog/0021/05_2.jpg" alt="Add alt text"/></span></p>
  <p>got his mind on his money and his money from da CRIME (and/or composing for television and movies, y'know, whichever)</p>
</div>

Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don’t know, we’ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night.

We’ll be spinning the twelfth release in Volume 1, featuring two disks worth of the fantastic compositional work of the utterly legendary Tony Hatch--and when I say "legendary" I mean it.

He [performed with David Bowie](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/09/david-bowie-lower-third-bbc-verdict-documentary-the-first-five-years). He arranged, wrote, and produced for the likes of Chubby Checker, Benny Hill, and The Drifters. He composed the soundtrack for _The Champions_, _Love Story_, and _Airline_. And he ended up knighted as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. 

Hatch is a living legend of film and television scores, and we've got two disks worth of his life's work for you tonight.

That’s about it for this month! Thanks again for reading, and I genuinely hope you all tune in and join us. Next month is February, which--while it doesn't mark the first broadcast of The Jazz Program by a long shot--marks the first anniversary of me plotting out our programming in these writeups for all of you to enjoy.

Stay safe, and I’ll see you all soon.

–Piper
