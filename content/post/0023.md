  <p>FUCK YOU IT'S THE JAZZ PROGRAM!</p>
</div>

Hey y'all! As the vast majority of you know, I've been the host of The Jazz Program on [datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm) for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I've decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we're going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of February of 2024.

If you'd like to tune in, [head on over to datafruits.fm/chat](https://datafruits.fm/chat) on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you'd like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we're broadcasting this week...well, read on.

That’s about it for this month! Thanks again for reading, and I genuinely hope you all tune in and join us. Next month is February, which--while it doesn't mark the first broadcast of The Jazz Program by a long shot--marks the first anniversary of me plotting out our programming in these writeups for all of you to enjoy.

Stay safe, and I’ll see you all soon.

–Piper
