Hey ya'll! As you know, it's been a good minute since I've had the time to sit down and write a full-on Studio Update. We're finally settled in--mostly--in the new studio[^1], and I wanted to check in and let y'all know what's coming down the pike, what I've been up to, and where I'm planning on heading next.

## WHAT'S NEXT

That's about the long and short of it! Sorry for the absence; this move took a lot out of myself and the crew, but it was a long time coming and was (and hopefully will continue to be) well worth it. 

I'll be back soon with a less serious column; namely, the next installment of The Finer Things. Lord knows I could use a break from talking about work, and besides, I want to blab your ear off about the Dirty Harry series. It may take a minute to get it all penned up and uploaded; I added wordcounts to posts in [the most recent update of the site code](/post/misc_truckstopupdate/) and seeing as [the last one](/post/0011) hovered around eight and a half grand...you get the idea. But it'll be entertaining, and (hopefully, as always) worth reading if you care to give my ramblin's a bit of your time.

I also have quite a few new Photo Rolls to upload, and a few new other features to update this ol' site with as well, not to mention a new update for the [main site](https://sarahallenreed.com) to boot. That will hopefully be up relatively soon as well.

Thank you all, as always, for reading and for sticking with me. You're all amazing and don't let anyone tell you that you're not. See you soon.
