  <p>Hey ya&rsquo;ll! As you know, it&rsquo;s been a good minute since I&rsquo;ve had the time to sit down and write a full-on Studio Update. We&rsquo;re finally settled in&ndash;mostly&ndash;in the new studio<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and I wanted to check in and let y&rsquo;all know what&rsquo;s coming down the pike, what I&rsquo;ve been up to, and where I&rsquo;m planning on heading next.</p>

  <p>Issue 2 on the drawing board.</a></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://ourladymaven.com/">Our Lady Maven</a> Issue 2 is well underway at this point. This particular issue is a bit longer than the last, but seeing as I&rsquo;m finally out of Colorado and in a slightly better headspace it shouldn&rsquo;t take nearly as long for me to knock these pages in. Three of the pages of the issue are already complete, and five more are on my drawing board right now.</p>
<p>This issue goes into a bit of the origin story of our beloved protagonist Anna Leavenworth, as well as shows off her mastery of disguises and the mentor she got her affinity for them from. It also contains some of the most brutal scenes in the story to date, and I&rsquo;m super stoked to get these done and share them with all of you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tossed up a small gallery of process photos over in the <a href="/tags/photo-roll">Photo Roll</a> section; <a href="/post/photoroll05/">you can check them out here.</a> And, if you feel so inclined, you can also <a href="/post/update_olm/">check out the Update Thread here</a>, check out the <a href="https://ourladymaven.com">official Our Lady Maven site</a> or even <a href="https://globalcomix.com/c/our-lady-maven/chapters/en/1/1">go give Issue 1 a read on Globalcomix</a>. I highly recommend you do, although I may be biased. Em and I put a lot of work into this series, and we&rsquo;re both real damn proud of it.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://kc-comics.com">Cabbage</a> and I&rsquo;s new comic series, The Garden, is also underway, and we&rsquo;re starting off with a series of short vignettes. Following the adventures of a young dork who doesn&rsquo;t quite fit in with the world at large but fits in just fine with the plants and the creatures of the woods around her house, The Garden isn&rsquo;t my <em>first</em> foray into more friendly fare, but it is one I&rsquo;m ending up very proud of. Cab&rsquo;s a very good friend of mine and an accomplished author and comics journalist in their own right, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying the universe and world we&rsquo;re building together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two photo rolls <a href="/post/photoroll03/">here</a> and <a href="/post/photoroll04/">here</a> over on the <a href="/tags/photo-roll">Photo Roll</a> section right now, and I&rsquo;ll be making more and updating them as progress happens. If you want a more consolidated place to check the updates, <a href="/post/update_garden/">you can also check out the Update Thread here.</a></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a formal website for the project up just yet, but you can always <a href="https://muckrack.com/christa-harader">check out their portfolio on Muckrack</a> if you&rsquo;d like to see more of Cab&rsquo;s journalistic work, or <a href="https://kc-comics.com">check their website</a> to learn a bit more about your local friendly veggie.</p>

  <p>A rough draft of the content warning for the current draft of BARREN, or &quot;a big list 'o' reasons why I don't have high hopes for a publisher going to bat for this one&quot;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="barren-ghosts-and-lines-of-succession">BARREN, GHOSTS, AND LINES OF SUCCESSION</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally nearly done with plotting out and drafting the new (and hopefully final) draft of Barren before it heads to the horrifying land of &ldquo;pitching&rdquo;. To be frank, however, in the past year or so since <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVaV5LO-PW/">I originally got the grant to start reworking this one</a> (obligatory thank you to the Canadian patron saint of comics, Annie Koyama, for her support and belief in me and my work there) I&rsquo;ve become more than a bit concerned with my odds of this going past the pitch stage due to how much the industry has changed in the past few years, and I&rsquo;ve been staring down the barrel of publishing it myself.</p>
<p>I bring this up because of <em>where</em> I might be putting it. Namely, I&rsquo;ve been working on a spiritual successor to the long-dead <a href="https://tabularosetta.cfw.me/">Tabula Rosetta</a>, which the original draft of <a href="https://tabularosetta.cfw.me/comics/139/">Barren</a> appeared in, to serially publish the new version and (hopefully) completed graphic novel in.</p>
<p>I have literally no answers as to when, where, or how this heir to TR will be available. I&rsquo;ve not even settled on a title for it yet. However, after years of not being able to even attempt to finish a personal piece for the life of me while stuck in the mountains and rotting from the inside, I seem to have finally found a way to tap into the artistic energy that I channeled while working on TR all those years ago. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I&rsquo;m off the bottle, maybe the fact that I&rsquo;m near my rivers again means I can tap back into the Styx, maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve basically logged off of and am now away from current industry trends where shit like Tabula Rosetta isn&rsquo;t allowed to be made anymore, or maybe I just missed the quiet of the woods.</p>
<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0016/03.png"><img src="/blog/0016/03.png" alt="The opening image from Tabula Rosetta, Issue 8."></a></p>
  <p>If you think I'm joking about the "burning my own books, taking a photo, and putting it in later books" line, here's one instance. From Tabula Rosetta, Issue 8.</p>
</div>
<p>Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;m feeling the urge to actually pick up the pen again, as well as finally feeling that strange, ghastly hand on my shoulder that I felt all those years ago that gently reminds me that this is what I was born to do, damned or not.</p>
<p>And sure, it may be Stockholm syndrome, but I <em>missed</em> that hand of madness on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked on, edited, or even visited the webcomic version of Tabula Rosetta in years&ndash;the tabularosetta.com domain name even expired without me noticing until now, otherwise I&rsquo;d be directing you all there&ndash;but it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating going back to the &ldquo;What Is Tabula Rosetta&rdquo; section and looking back at <a href="https://tabularosetta.cfw.me/whatistabularosetta/">how simultaneously utterly cocksure of my own abilities I was and completely comfortable with being as utterly insane as i used to be/to some degree still am.</a> This isn&rsquo;t me <em>belittling</em> myself here; I <em>miss</em> those qualities in my work.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t exaggerations either; hell, Tabula Rosetta itself was billed as being&ndash;and very much was&ndash;as fucked up as I was during the years I spent chronicling the crevices of my inordinately damaged subconscious in its pages. Half the cover art pieces for the print issues literally came to me in hallucinations. The only nudes in the entirety of this mature-readers-only-labelled series were mutilated depictions of my own corpse<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I burned my own books, took pictures of myself doing so, and use those photos as illustrations in the later books. I wrote half the series while literally homeless, and it wasn&rsquo;t even the first piece of work I had ever made while without a permanent address&ndash;by the time TR finished publications, we were up to the double digits in terms of &ldquo;major releases in my <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre">oeuvre</a> released while unhoused&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This series was <em>batshit</em>, and as much as I both love and hate its existence, working on it kept me alive at the time, and it&rsquo;s still some of the finest work I&rsquo;ve ever done to boot.</p>
<p>The issue is, when I say &ldquo;yeah the industry has very much changed&rdquo;, I am saying this from a perspective of someone who used to be this genuinely and unabashedly batshit and could actually <em>go places</em> and find people who appreciate that work despite both my and my work&rsquo;s lack of ability to pander to nostalgia, appeal to a fandom, or be marketable whatsoever by any stretch of the definition. You can&rsquo;t fund a Kickstarter with a series like this, you can&rsquo;t make it go viral on Twitter or Reddit by posting the marketing-department-friendly affirmational pandering that it doesn&rsquo;t have, and you sure as shit won&rsquo;t be able to get this thing past Instagram or Tiktok&rsquo;s algorithmic censors. As far as most literary firms&rsquo; acquisition departments are concerned, this puppy&rsquo;s dead in the water.</p>
<p>Fact of the matter is, due to a lot of seismic shifts in how this field and industry works, I genuinely cannot think of a single publisher that still exists and has not folded either pre- or post-pandemic that would touch something like a reworked heir to TR even <em>with</em> my current portfolio, publication history, and prowess.</p>
<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0016/06.png"><img src="/blog/0016/06.png" alt="The opening image from Tabula Rosetta, Issue 8."></a></p>
  <p>We ain't usin' the phrase &quot;weird shit&quot; lightly here, son. From the original draft of Barren, published in Tabula Rosetta, issue 9.</p>
</div>
<p>If you <em>can</em> think of one, though, or&ndash;even better!&ndash;you happen to run one and you&rsquo;re interested, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">please get in touch</a>. I may be in the market for a publishing partner on this, because I&rsquo;ve always been garbage at keeping the logistics running on my lonesome. And who knows? I&rsquo;m not known for keeping in touch with the goings-on, so there&rsquo;s good odds that someone has popped up in the industry that I haven&rsquo;t seen yet. I sure hope so&ndash;this medium needs folks willing to run the weird shit.</p>
<p>But if I can&rsquo;t find a publisher, that leaves me and my unique brand of chaos.</p>
<p>And that chaos happens to leave me with quite a few more options than most folk want me to have.</p>
<p>Industry viability be damned. I miss this version of myself and my work, and I want to tap into this again. I&rsquo;ve had to neuter a lot of myself to find work to keep the homefires burning over the last few years, and I don&rsquo;t much want to do that to myself and my work anymore&ndash;for this industry, for the current generation of &ldquo;comics fans&rdquo;, or for anyone. I fucking hate having let myself be suckered into being the kid who doesn&rsquo;t do shit anymore because no one wants to run with it, and I miss having the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cojones">cojones</a> to tell the powers that be and the cats who expect the same stuff everyone else is doing to eat pavement. I miss being obnoxiously queer, unapologetically vengeful, and openly emotional in my work. And I miss doing what I will and fusing outsider and high-concept art with a stapler and a pen whether anyone understood what I was doing or not. If that means I&rsquo;m running this back myself, that&rsquo;s what this means. I intend to return to form.</p>
<p>And, at least at the moment, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the works. This whole thing has a long, long way to go, and I still have to tidy up my own affairs and get my shit together (<a href="/post/0017/#getting-my-shit-together">as I talk about down below in the &ldquo;Getting My Shit Together&rdquo; section</a>) before I can commit fully to it or feel comfortable self-publishing a full, proper project again. But, regardless, this is where my head&rsquo;s at with the whole deal. More details will come soon, and (hopefully) there&rsquo;ll be pages of the opening chapters of Barren along with them. So&ndash;as always&ndash;stay tuned.</p>

</div>
<p>So, as you all know, Long Long Stinky Man has taken everyone&rsquo;s least favorite hellsite on a mission to find a place deeper than hell to piledrive it into. Us professional illustrator types have been particularly screwed by this&ndash;Twitter was, for most of us, a professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang">zugzwang</a> we all were trapped in and had to use to try and find jobs, gigs, and commissions on top of the usual metagame of trying to avoid being that day&rsquo;s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character">Main Character</a> and getting called fun slurs by Nazis if we just so happened to be anything other than white cis dudes.</p>
<p>As most of you know, I haven&rsquo;t had an account on there since, like, last October. So where am I at now?</p>
<p>I currently have a few social media accounts I&rsquo;ve been using to cover the bases, but the one I&rsquo;m most focused on actually using is Mastodon. You can find me over on <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed">defcon.social</a> for now (if that changes, I&rsquo;ll do my best to come back and edit this article to reflect that), and while I still am on Instagram <a href="/post/0005/">despite them damn near banning me for no reason</a> I have also moved over to Pixelfed, and <a href="https://pixelfed.social/@sarahallenreed">you can find me over there as well.</a></p>
<p>I have a few other accounts as well,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but to be frank I have next to no desire to promote my presence on non-free sites I do not directly manage anymore. FLOSS social media protocols are one thing, and if you want updates you can get &lsquo;em here or on <a href="https://sarahallenreed.com">the main site</a>, but corpo-owned tripe ain&rsquo;t my bag anymore. If you find me on &lsquo;em, though, I sure hope they lead you here.</p>
<p>I also genuinely hope more cartoonists, illustrators, and creatives roll their own websites and blogs again. The web&rsquo;s going to keep going to hell if we leave it in the hands of these corpo bougie fucks. We can take it back, though; and damnit, we should.</p>

</div>
<p>Now for the best news of all: we finally escaped from Denver.</p>
<p>Ended up back on the banks of the rivers I was born next to, albeit a few hundred miles north of my original spawn point. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Most of the past month has been Autumn, Polyhymnia and I finally settling in as best we can, trying to find day jobs to build our cash stacks back, and hopefully making a place for both of us to create, make art, and hopefully keep working on games and comix together in.</p>
<p>The trip took us eight hundred and fifty miles from Denver to the Quad Cities, and was a lovely (if stressful) trip out of the Front Range and through Nebraska, Iowa, and into Illinois. I honestly forgot how much I missed the road&ndash;rambling along, seeing the world go by, stopping at interesting things as they catch my eye&ndash;and it&rsquo;s made me miss the freedom that comes with living nomadically.</p>
<p>So, now that we&rsquo;re here and settling in, my main goal is to hopefully save up and get myself a new ship. I&rsquo;ve no idea if the Diogenes&rsquo; Barrel Mk. 4<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> will be a full-on RV or just a van with a campin&rsquo; stove and a cot in it, but once I get the cash, I&rsquo;ll be grabbing the keys and then I&rsquo;ll probably be back to wanderin&rsquo; and&ndash;possibly&ndash;back on tour.</p>
<h3 id="no-dates-scheduled">NO DATES SCHEDULED</h3>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of touring&hellip;it should be mentioned that, yes, we also aren&rsquo;t that far from the underground comix mecca that is Chicago, but I don&rsquo;t plan on making much of that right now, especially in terms of going to cons or meetups. Over the past few years (and especially in the past few months), I&rsquo;ve had to re-learn one of the more unpleasant lessons I always seem to forget: I am not particularly good at making friends, <em>especially</em> with other artists.</p>
<p>Part of this is because of how I use and view my work&ndash;which constantly seems at odds with the industry at large and my peers in general, as touched on above in the <a href="/post/0016/#barren-ghosts-and-lines-of-succession">&quot;Barren, Ghosts, And Lines Of Succession&quot; section above</a>&ndash;but the other part of that really just boils down to the fact that I and most of you have had violently different lives, and I don&rsquo;t have the toolkit to hide that from people like everyone else does. The buffer of the page and the magnetic tape kind of do wonders to shield audiences from the fact that&ndash;like most cartoonists&ndash;I&rsquo;m not exactly what you would call &ldquo;fun at parties&rdquo;, and&ndash;unlike most of my peers&ndash;I&rsquo;m also the opposite of what one would call &ldquo;soft, likable, geeky, and approachable&rdquo;, which I&rsquo;ve found can be a death sentence in and of itself if I can&rsquo;t manage to mask it properly and pretend to be someone I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0016/05.jpg"><img src="/blog/0016/05.jpg" alt="The opening image from Tabula Rosetta, Issue 8."></a></p>
  <p>me when i finally lose my mind, quit this bitch, and hit the road</p>
</div>
<p>Add into that the isolation of the past few years, combine it with the whammy of getting sober and removing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_courage">Dutch courage</a> from my toolkit, and pile on the weight of exactly how fucked the last few years have been&hellip;and yeah, my autistic ass is up a creek without a paddle when it comes to navigating the fun waters of networking and in-industry socialization. The few times I&rsquo;ve tried to reach out to find community with other creatives since getting sober have very much seen me floundering at best and fuarrking everything up at worst, and to be honest I&rsquo;m a bit out of spoons to keep trying.</p>
<p>So, at this time, I do not currently have any plans to attend conventions, play shows, or do anything else along those lines. Maybe once I get my head a bit more together and can mask a bit better, but not right now. Right now, I just wanna try an&rsquo; have a social life that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> revolve around this work.</p>
<p>Hell, man, who knows. I might just get my ship, take the keys, and disappear into the wide open yonder forever, leaving comix, polite society, and The Discourse behind for good. World&rsquo;s a big ol&rsquo; place, and if that&rsquo;s what I gotta do to track down that <a href="https://www.shelsilverstein.com/9780060256715/the-missing-piece/">missing piece</a> that fell outta my brain all these years ago, maybe that&rsquo;ll be the route I take. I miss the road far more than I miss having tour stops and places to be along that road.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="getting-my-shit-together">GETTING MY SHIT TOGETHER</h3>
<p>Finally, if I have one goal for the rest of the year outside of contractual obligations, it&rsquo;s to get my head back on straight and the rest of BLACKWORK&rsquo;s affairs back in order. It&rsquo;s been a bit of an open secret that the past couple years have been some of the worst in my (admittedly horrifyingly tough) life. I won&rsquo;t go into the exact sequence of events here (although <a href="/post/0009/">I did touch on one specific Bad Time here on this blog</a>) but let me put it this way.</p>
<div class="floatright caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0016/08.png"><img src="/blog/0016/08.png" alt="The wreckage of my beloved '85, Medusa."></a></p>
  <p>Didn't even break the top three.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2021, I got hit by a bus. That&rsquo;s not a bad joke or a metaphor, I mean <em>a literal bus</em>. My beloved &lsquo;85 here, Medusa, which I was in the process of buying a trailer RV for, was totalled. The impact rocked my truck with enough force to push the block clear through the steel frame. I lost my transportation, lost my means of transporting a trailer for me to live out of and escape Colorado in, and damn near lost my day job on top of that.</p>
<p>That was the <em>fifth</em> most traumatic thing to happen in the past four years. You read that right. Getting hit by a bus&ndash;the type of car wreck that you <em>literally use as a metaphor for an event that knocks your life out of whack, not to mention an event that could have very easily killed me and almost put my ass back on the streets</em>&ndash; ranks <em><strong>fifth.</strong></em><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve been in the lurch for some years now.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to <em>stay</em> that way. It&rsquo;s not fair to me, and it&rsquo;s not fair to all of you either.</p>
<p>First on the docket once I get the studio in order is clearing out the backlog. I have a few commissions I need to complete still for some of you fine folk, and I have a few packages of comix to send out from the web store from very, very long overdue orders. Aside from those, <em>I will be closing new commissions and closing the webstore for the forseeable future.</em> I want time to get my head back together, time to re-learn how to draw for myself, time to build back a lot of the things I lost over the past few years.</p>
<p>Living with the double whammy of autism and ADHD with no access to medication or help of any kind is rough enough when you aren&rsquo;t going through year after year of getting whacked over the noggin with traumatic event after traumatic event, but I&rsquo;ve had to play this hand long enough to know how to deal with it once things settle down<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Hopefully, things <em>stay</em> settled down, and I can get this new incarnation of the studio back up to what it was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the long and short of it! Sorry for the absence; this move took a lot out of myself and the crew, but it was a long time coming and was (and hopefully will continue to be) well worth it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back soon with a less serious column; namely, the next installment of The Finer Things. Lord knows I could use a break from talking about work, and besides, I want to blab your ear off about the Dirty Harry series. It may take a minute to get it all penned up and uploaded; I added wordcounts to posts in <a href="/post/misc_truckstopupdate/">the most recent update of the site code</a> and seeing as <a href="/post/0011">the last one</a> hovered around eight and a half grand&hellip;you get the idea. But it&rsquo;ll be entertaining, and (hopefully, as always) worth reading if you care to give my ramblin&rsquo;s a bit of your time.</p>
<p>I also have quite a few new Photo Rolls to upload, and a few new other features to update this ol&rsquo; site with as well, not to mention a new update for the <a href="https://sarahallenreed.com">main site</a> to boot. That will hopefully be up relatively soon as well.</p>
<p>Thank you all, as always, for reading and for sticking with me. You&rsquo;re all amazing and don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&rsquo;re not. See you soon.</p>

<p>I do plan on making a Photo Roll of the new joint as we put it all together, but it&rsquo;s not quite there yet. Soon! <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I&rsquo;m putting this in the footnotes, because I want to add in a trigger warning to it&ndash;sure, Tabula Rosetta carried with it a mature content warning, but this site doesn&rsquo;t and I want to at least warn you first. With that said, if you want to see one of the more explicit examples of me doing so, <a href="/blog/0016/00.png">here&rsquo;s the self-portrait from Issue 9, the final issue of Tabula Rosetta to ever be published.</a> Fair warning, the image contains a decapitated, nude, transfeminine body&ndash;my own&ndash;hanging from a noose. I was not joking about the intensity of this series here. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p><a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110962544357932869">As I bitched about at length over on Mastodon</a>, I have actively been avoiding using Bsky, as it genuinely seems like a worse, more fucked up, and toxic version of Twitter , where everyone actually seems to be <em>trying</em> to be the main character for reasons I cannot possibly fathom. I have no desire to be the main character of anything, much less of Twitter: Thunderdome Edition, so I&rsquo;m mainly just sitting on that account so no one else takes my username and using it for <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> shit. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I was actually born on the banks of the Missouri river, not the Mississippi, but seeing as the Missouri and Mississippi don&rsquo;t actually split until they hit <a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/70413">somewhere around Arcadia</a>, they&rsquo;re basically the same thing until then. Look, I just missed my rivers, alright? After four years stuck in the Rockies, I&rsquo;ll take what I can get. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I name all of the vehicles I&rsquo;ve lived in &ldquo;Diogenes&rsquo; Barrel Mk. $ITERATION_NUMBER&rdquo; after two things, one historical, one personal. The historical&rsquo;s fairly obvious; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes">Diogenes of Sinope</a>, the philosopher I often joke about being my real father (since I have no idea who my actual one is), lived in a barrel as a rejection of the world, and I figure a van isn&rsquo;t much but a barrel on wheels. The personal is a bit more&hellip;well, personal. An old friend of mine, years ago, used to refer to computers he&rsquo;d build or vehicles he&rsquo;d drive as $ANIME_CHARACTER Mk. $NUMBERED_ITERATION due to his obsession with anime and military history, and I stole that naming scheme from him. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Second on the list was <a href="/post/0009/">the events I wrote about in &ldquo;Stone Jaw: Trans Healthcare And Other Cognitohazards&rdquo;</a> here on this very blog. With that stated, I do not feel comfortable listing the fourth, third, and first on that list point-blank in <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/cleartext">cleartext</a>, given how they directly involve a lot of real-life people and I don&rsquo;t think enough time has passed for the veil of years to obfuscate who is who enough to put it in writing as point-blank as I would need to. I did try to talk about the events in question at the time in certain circles, but if you weren&rsquo;t around for &lsquo;em, they&rsquo;ll probably make their way into one of my books or records or an interview or something at some point. <a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I also lift and <a href="https://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/what-is-a-ruck-great-question">ruck</a> multiple times a week, and smoke enough cigars and drink enough coffee to kill a horse. So that helps. If you can&rsquo;t afford a doc and they wouldn&rsquo;t give you the meds you need anyways even if you could, turns out killing yourself in the gym and downing obscene amounts of stimulants works fine enough. &lsquo;Murica. <a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
