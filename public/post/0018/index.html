  <p>Hey y&rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on <a href="https://datafruits.fm">datafruits.fm</a> for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of October of 2023.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to tune in, <a href="https://datafruits.fm/chat">head on over to datafruits.fm/chat</a> on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&rsquo;re broadcasting this week&hellip;well, read on.</p>
<div class="floatleft caption">

  <p> man look at 'em go </p>
</div>
<p>Usually, I have a big ol&rsquo; historical overlook, sit-down-with-gramma-type story about my life in jazz, or some record recommendations here for you to open up the article and get you all in the mood to tune into the program. We aren&rsquo;t doing that this month, though&mdash;sadly, I&rsquo;ve been swamped this month with life stuff, and as much as I&rsquo;d love to have something clever to share with you all<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;m plumb out of the brain cells required to get something like that ready for all of you.</p>
<p>Next month, however&hellip;I&rsquo;ve got my eye on a big change to how we do these things. Stay tuned, and in the meantime, have this .gif of some old-timey jazz skelington mans to get you in that oh-so-spoopy mood.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s jump right into it.</p>

  <p> E&amp;S tracked down <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/02/suspense-the-burning-court.html">a slightly different cover art piece</a> to The Burning Court, but I wanted to highlight the 1954 Bantam edition's cover, featuring some gorgeous brushwork by English-American pulp illustrator Charles Binger.</p>

<h4 id="talkie-time--suspsense-month-episode-1-the-burning-court--wet-saturday">Talkie Time : SUSPSENSE MONTH EPISODE 1: The Burning Court / Wet Saturday</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s October, and the spooks, thrills, and murders are taking over the airwaves for Talkie Time. Every single day this month, we&rsquo;ll be playing the original run of Suspense starting (almost&ndash;we&rsquo;re skipping the pilot for now) from the top.</p>
<p>I want to give a major shoutout to <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/">Escape And Suspense!</a> here&ndash;they&rsquo;ve done a lot of the ground work for me when it comes to giving these fantastic episodes their due diligence, and I&rsquo;d be a terrible old time radio head if I didn&rsquo;t link their writeups for these episodes here for you to peruse.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Suspense isn&rsquo;t a series I&rsquo;ve spent too much time with&ndash;I&rsquo;m much more of a Phillip Marlowe kinda gal&ndash;so if you want the words of someone who knows what they&rsquo;re on about, go give their writeups a read.</p>
<p>This week, we&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/02/suspense-the-burning-court.html">&quot;The Burning Court&quot;</a>, originally aired on June 17, 1942 and based on John Dickinson Carr&rsquo;s novel of the same name (again, Escape And Suspense covers this on their blog, and I have them to thank for sourcing a <em>lot</em> of the links to the original books these episodes are often based on). After that, we&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2012/10/suspense-wet-saturday.html">&quot;Wet Saturday&quot;</a>, based on John Collier&rsquo;s short of the same name, which originally aired the following week on June 24, 1942.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="the-jazz-program-listener-request-night-its-autumn-baby">The Jazz Program LISTENER REQUEST NIGHT: It&rsquo;s Autumn, Baby</h4>
<p>The leaves are beginning to brown and fall across the land, the air is getting chillier, and my sister Autumn Redacted would probably not let me hear the end of it if I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> let her do the request line for October, namesake or not. She might not <em>look</em> like the epitome of frights and spoops as much as she looks soft and friendly, but as it turns out, spending too long studying bioethics on a collegiate level as a trans person tends to fill your brain with horrors unimaginable to the average layperson.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got three of her favorite trip-hop records tonight for you this evening&ndash;Nujabes&rsquo; &quot;Modal Soul&quot; (released in 2005), Wax Tailor&rsquo;s &quot;By Any Beats Necessary&quot;(released 2006), and Massive Attack&rsquo;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; (released 1998) to finish off the evning..</p>
<p>And, of course, if you&rsquo;ve got a few records you wanna hear on Listener Request Night, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">hit up the email inbox and send me what you&rsquo;ve got.</a></p>

<h4 id="talkie-time--suspsense-month-episode-2-the-cave-of-ali-baba--the-hitch-hiker">Talkie Time : SUSPSENSE MONTH EPISODE 2: The Cave Of Ali Baba / The Hitch-Hiker</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s October, and the spooks, thrills, and murders are taking over the airwaves for Talkie Time. Every single day this month, we&rsquo;ll be playing the original run of Suspense starting (almost&ndash;we&rsquo;re skipping the pilot for now) from the top.</p>
<p>Our pals at <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/">Escape And Suspense!</a> are again coming in clutch for my research here, and they&rsquo;ve already covered both of these on their blog. Go give them a read.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stepping into episodes 4 and 5 here this evening. First up is <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/03/suspense-the-cave-of-ali-baba.html">&quot;The Cave Of Ali Baba&quot;</a>, based on the short of the same name by Dorothy L. Sayers (which can be found in a couple different short story collections, <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/03/suspense-the-cave-of-ali-baba.html">according to our friends over at E&amp;S</a>), and which originally aired on August 14, 1942. After that, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2007/03/suspense_the_hi.html">&quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;</a>, originally airing on September 2, 1942, and starring none other than Orson Welles himself in the main role. Most folks, however, probably know this story from another source&ndash;namely, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitch-Hiker_(The_Twilight_Zone)">television adaptation on none other than The Twilight Zone</a>, starring Inger Stevens in the lead role and Leonard Strong as the hitch-hiker himself.</p>
<h4 id="the-jazz-program-bohren--der-club-of-gore---midnight-radio-1997">The Jazz Program: Bohren &amp; der Club Of Gore - Midnight Radio (1997)</h4>
<div class="floatleft caption">
  <p><a href= "/blog/0018/05.jpg"><img src="/blog/0018/05.jpg" alt="A portrait of Autumn."></a></p>
  <p> I wanted to play Piano Nights here, but we'll save that fantastic record for another time. </a> </p>
</div>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be spoopy month if we didn&rsquo;t at least have <em>one</em> seasonally appropriate selection. Fortunately for you, we have three nights worth of space to take up, and god damn it we&rsquo;re gonna use all of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a few places we <em>could</em> have started Spoopy Month off, but very few of the options are as iconic to the concept of &ldquo;darkjazz&rdquo; as Bohren &amp; der Club Of Gore. Thorsten Benning&rsquo;s foundational ambient jazz outfit has several fantastic records to their name, and it&rsquo;s dollars to donuts that we&rsquo;ll get to all of &rsquo;em at some point. This month, though, we&rsquo;ve got a monster of a record for you&ndash;1997&rsquo;s &quot;Midnight Radio&quot;.</p>
<p>And boy howdy, when I say &quot;a monster of a record&quot; I do mean in terms of length as well as historical impact&ndash;this whole beast is well over our two hour time limit. I&rsquo;m gonna do my damnest to stay up and play the whole thing for you, though, and you absolutely should stay up late and join us. Who needs sleep, anyways? Fuck a day job. Call in sick and tell &rsquo;em The Jazz Program sent ya.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ve got spooky season on lock with even more episodes of Suspense, and once again I&rsquo;d like to thank our budies at <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com">Escape And Supsense!</a> for doing most of my work for me. Again, please go give their blog a look&ndash;if you&rsquo;re as big of a nerd about this stuff as I am, it&rsquo;ll be damn well worth your time.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2007/10/suspense---th-1.html">&quot;The Kettler Method&quot;</a>, written by Peter Barry and originally airing on September 16, 1942. E&amp;R calls this one &quot;so classic, that it borders on parody&quot;, and I gotta agree with them&ndash;it&rsquo;s good old fashioned schlocky goodness, starring a good doctor who&rsquo;s lost his marbles and probably shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted with other folks&rsquo; brains.</p>
<p>Right after that we&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/09/suspense-a-.html">&quot;A Passage To Benares&quot;</a>, originally aired on September 23, 1942. &quot; A Passage to Benares&quot; was originally written by T.S. Stribling and first published as a short story in the February 20, 1926 edition of &quot;Adventure Magazine&quot;&ndash;which, if you&rsquo;re interested, <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/luminist/PU/ADV_1926_02_20.pdf">can be found here</a> thanks to our friends at the legendary archivist circle <a href="https://luminist.org">The Luminist League</a> who has catalogued, scanned, and converted to digital formats damn near the entirety of <a href="http://www.luminist.org/archives/PU/ADV.htm">Adventure Magazine&rsquo;s run</a> as well as a great many other classic pulps.

<p>Buckle the fuck up, kids, cuz we&rsquo;re leaving the ghosts behind in favor of dragons. Formed in 1999, The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble is so far up my alley it&rsquo;s almost comical&ndash;hell, they originally started as a project dedicated to scoring silent movies, and we all know how I feel about old-timey television and radio.</p>
<p>Sadly, they&rsquo;re not with us anymore&ndash;having disbanded in 2013&ndash;but their music lives on, and while I couldn&rsquo;t manage to track down their accompaniments to F.W. Murnau&rsquo;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; or Fritz Lang&rsquo;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, I do in fact have copies of both 2009&rsquo;s Youtube-recommendation-core<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> classic &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; and 2011&rsquo;s &quot;From The Stairwell&quot;, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got in the pipe for you this evening.</p>
<p>(Oh, and if you happen to have a recording of their silent film work&hellip;<a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">then what are you waiting for, man? For the love of god, email me that shit!</a> We NEED that one for next year&rsquo;s Halloween!)</p>

  <p> A stunning cover art to John Dickenson Carr's &quot;The Hollow Man&quot;, which for the life of me I cannot find a cover art credit for. Which is a damn shame because, hell, look at it. It's gorgeous.</a>. </p>
</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost Halloween, and we&rsquo;re keeping up the suspense with&hellip;well, more Suspense. What else?</p>
<p>Tonight we&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2010/07/suspense-one-hundred-in-the-dark.html">&quot;One Hundred In The Dark&quot;</a>, originally airing on September 30, 1942, and adapted from the short story of the same name by Owen M. Johnson. And, right after that, we&rsquo;ve got &quot;The Lord Of The Witch Doctors&quot;, originally aired on October 27, 1942&ndash;which, somehow, is one of the only Suspense episodes our friends over at <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com">Escape And Suspense</a> don&rsquo;t seem to have a write-up on, and which I&rsquo;ve been drug kicking and screaming down a train of thought on.</p>
<p>See, it&rsquo;s based on an original script by John Dickenson Carr, a damn prolific American detective author who&rsquo;s perhaps best known for his 1935 masterpiece &quot;The Hollow Man&quot;. I was going to leave the cover art to that classic here, credit the cover artist, and call it a day, but fascinatingly enough I can&rsquo;t seem to track down the cover illustrator for this one. It&rsquo;s a shame because this particular piece is absolutely gorgeous, and strangely enough I can&rsquo;t even track down much in the way of details as to this particular release of the book, save <a href="https://jiescribano.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/my-book-notes-the-hollow-man-aka-the-three-coffins-1935-dr-fell-6-by-john-dickson-carr/">this partiucular write-up on jiescribano&rsquo;s Wordpress page</a>, <a href="https://www.dustjackets.com/pages/books/576/john-dickson-carr/hollow-man-the">this website which sells fascimile dust jackets for vintage pulps and happens to have a copy of it</a> and <a href="http://blog.librimondadori.it/blogs/ilgiallomondadori/2012/01/12/dissertando-di-camere-chiuse/">this Italian write-up on the book itself</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to ADHD and my love of the illustrative art form, it seems that I&rsquo;m gonna get drug down a rabbit hole here. I&rsquo;m planning on emailing the Fascimile Dust Jackets company and seeing if they know who did the cover art here, but if you happen to know who it is and want to let me know, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">email me</a> or <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed">get ahold of me over on Mastodon</a>. I&rsquo;m losing my mind over here&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;which, in fairness, is pretty normal for me. But still!</p>

  <p> It wouldn't be a proper Jazz Program writeup if I didn't go out of my way to point out the fantastic cover art here, done by none other than British science fiction iillustration legend <a href="https://www.alisoneldred.com/jim-burns/illustration-1/">Jim Burns.</a> </p>

<p>Hey, you remember <a href="/post/0012/#the-jazz-program-dj-spooky---celestial-mechanix-the-blue-series-mastermix-2004">way back</a> when I said we&rsquo;d get around to playing even more DJ Spooky?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is when we&rsquo;re doing it. And lemme tell ya we couldn&rsquo;t have <em>picked</em> a better evening. We&rsquo;re using the last iteration of The Jazz Program this month (yes, you heard that right&ndash;<a href="/post/0018/#october-31-2023----spooky-talkies-marathon">scroll down</a> to see what we&rsquo;re doing next week in lieu of more Jazz) to bring you even more of the spookiest DJ known to man, including his legendary collab with Slayer and Fantômas drummer Dave Lombardo.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting in with 2002&rsquo;s Optometry&ndash;which, if you didn&rsquo;t listen to it <a href="/post/0012/#the-jazz-program-dj-spooky---celestial-mechanix-the-blue-series-mastermix-2004">back in June</a> when I told you to, now&rsquo;s your chance&ndash;and finishing our last episode of The Jazz Program for October with 2005&rsquo;s Drums Of Death.</p>

<h3 id="october-31-2023----halloween-suspense-marathon">October 31, 2023 &ndash; HALLOWEEN SUSPENSE MARATHON</h3>
<p>Now, you might have noticed that <em>normally</em> we do Cloak And Dagger Night and Crime Jazz Night on the last Tuesday of the month. Thing is, that&rsquo;s not happening this month, becauuuuse it&rsquo;s HALLOWEEN, MOTHERFUCKERS, AND WE&rsquo;VE GOT YOU COVERED.</p>
<p>Starting at 9 CST, we&rsquo;re playing literally nothing but the most horrifying stories from the Suspense catalogue, starting where we left off last week. In order, we&rsquo;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The Devil In The Summer House&quot; (originally aired November 3, 1942),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2012/09/suspense-will-you-make-a-bet-with-death.html">&quot;Will You Make A Bet With Death?&quot;</a> (originally aired November 10, 1942),</li>
<li>&quot;Menace In Wax&quot; (originally aired November 17, 1942),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2007/05/suspense_the_bo.html">&quot;The Body Snatchers&quot;</a> (originally aired November 24, 1942),</li>
<li><a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2010/04/suspense-the-bride-vanishes.html">&quot;The Bride Vanishes</a> (originally aired December 1, 1942), and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com/2013/09/suspense-till-death-do-us-part-1942.html">&quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;</a> (originally aired December 15, 1942).</li>
</ul>
<p>And, one last time, thank you again to the fine folks over at <a href="https://www.escape-suspense.com">Escape And Suspense</a> for their impeccable research on this program, and to all the other old time radio heads who have put their tapes, research, and love of the genre and medium on the Internet for dorks like myself to hopefully contribute something useful to. I&rsquo;ve linked E&amp;S&rsquo;s articles on every episode I could find one on, so go read them if you haven&rsquo;t already&ndash;they&rsquo;re damn good.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s the show lineup for this month! I&rsquo;ll be back (hopefully) soon with a gargantuan installment of The Finer Things. See you then!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for tuning in. Have a good one.</p>

<p>Aside from the few ambient/darkjazz bands we&rsquo;re playing this month, I&rsquo;m weirdly unfamiliar with what one could call &ldquo;spooky jazz&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s definitely something I want to research at some point, so hopefully next year&rsquo;s October programming will have quite the long writeup about the history of spoopy happenings in and around jazz.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>If you missed it, I catalogued a couple of my other favorite sources and references for old time radio research on previous installments of The Jazz Program&rsquo;s calendar. <a href="http://localhost:1313/post/0004/#what-is-a-talkie-and-what-does-it-do">Most of &rsquo;em can be found here on the March 2023 writeup</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>I can&rsquo;t sign doctor&rsquo;s notes, sadly. But I&rsquo;ll <em>gladly</em> personally tell your boss to fuck off if he emails me asking why you were late.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of this term, &quot;Youtube-recommendation-core&quot; is a weird subsect of records that, as <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/list/SwordsDance/youtube-recommended-core/">one Rateyourmusic playlist author puts it</a>, are &quot;will follow you to hell and back until you finally click the damn link.&quot;. Youtube&rsquo;s algorithm, it seems, tends to get stuck on making sure <em>everyone on earth</em> listens to these records at <em>least</em> once, and you&rsquo;ve probably seen a few of them yourself. I&rsquo;ve never seen &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; on anyone else&rsquo;s list, but maybe that&rsquo;s because while most of the kids who <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/list/g_crowley/youtube-recommendation-core/">&quot;played in the aeroplane over the sea once&quot;</a> were first finding Neutral Milk Hotel&rsquo;s classic and coining this term back in the mid-2010s, I was listening to Bongripper&rsquo;s &quot;Miserable&quot; and Youtube kept trying to get me to listen to Here Be Dragons instead. And, from what I&rsquo;ve heard from other fans of the band, I&rsquo;m not alone in that.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
