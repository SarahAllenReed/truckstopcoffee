  <p>Hey y&rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on <a href="https://datafruits.fm">datafruits.fm</a> for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of August of 2023.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to tune in, <a href="https://datafruits.fm/chat">head on over to datafruits.fm/chat</a> on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&rsquo;re broadcasting this week&hellip;well, read on.</p>
<p>First, a bit of an explanation&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1BCAgu2I8">dah-ta-fruits turn their jazzy eyes to youuuuu&hellip;woo woo wooo&hellip;</a>anyways.</p>
<p>So, yeah. We&rsquo;ve been gone. Autumn, Polyhymnia, and I just finished up unpacking after a cross-country move back to the banks of the Mississippi in search of better scenes, cheaper rent, and actual decent cuisine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So, for the past month or so, I&rsquo;ve been filling in when I can, calling out when I can&rsquo;t, and coming up with the playlists as they come rather than adhering to some manner of grander plan, posting the plans for each evening as the evenings come over on <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed">Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>With that stated, I wanted to at least jot down the plans I <em>did</em> manage to make for each week&rsquo;s show. Y&rsquo;know, for posterity. Next month will be a glorious return to actual scheduling, complete with the return of a proper Listener Request Night, everyone&rsquo;s favorite dumbass theme nights, and some of the final iterations of Crime Jazz night before we switch over to a Secret New Theme Night<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to close out each month.</p>
<p>So, while you can&rsquo;t exactly go back and listen to the previous programs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, you <em>can</em> still take a read-through of what we played this month, if it&rsquo;s something that happens to strike your fancy. Let&rsquo;s get into the recap.</p>

<h2 id="august-2023-talkie-timejazz-program-schedule">August 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule</h2>
<h3 id="august-1-2023">August 1, 2023</h3>
<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t make this one&ndash;we were supposed to be already packed and out the door mid-week, so this was <em>supposed</em> to be the single planned absence before we docked down on the 8th, I plugged in my decks, and we hop on the air that evening. Unfortunately, as you&rsquo;ll see in next week&rsquo;s entry, we weren&rsquo;t even all in the van when the sun rose on the 8th, much less even halfway down the interstate. So this was a pre-record, <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110811879403883896">as I mentioned over on Mastodon</a>, and here&rsquo;s what the pre-record consisted of&hellip;</p>

  <p>The evening's playlist, along with a rare chronicle of the bump music I played before and between the sets.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="talkie-time--mercury-theater-on-the-air---the-man-who-was-thursday">Talkie Time : Mercury Theater On The Air - The Man Who Was Thursday</h4>
<p>Just two months before Orson Welles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)">pissed off the world and all the local yokels within it</a>, the Mercury Theater decided to adapt another story about mass confusion, havok, and uncertainty, albeit without all the aliens this time&ndash;namely, G.K. Chesterton&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Man Who Was Thursday&rdquo;. Anarchy, back-stabbery, metaphysics, and blokes named after days of the week abound in this fantastic adaptation of one of the most interesting and mind-rending explorations of modern politics, human psychology, and disillusionment this side of Kafka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Came_in_from_the_Cold">Alec Leamas</a> meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial">Josef K</a>, if you will.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;d like to check this out after the fact&ndash;as well as every other Mercury Theater On The Air broadcast, lovingly remastered by fans of the man and the medium and available for free&ndash;<a href="http://www.bornalone.org/man_who_was_thursday.html">go check out the fine folks at bornalone.org.</a> They&rsquo;ve got you covered.</p>
<h4 id="the-jazz-program--eric-dolphy---the-complete-uppsala-concert-1961--live-at-the-gaslight-inn-1962">The Jazz Program : Eric Dolphy - The Complete Uppsala Concert (1961) / Live At The Gaslight Inn (1962)</h4>
<p>Eric Dolphy needs no introduction; but if you need one anyways, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_to_Lunch!">go check out the cornerstone he chucked into the foundations of avant-garde jazz, &ldquo;Out To Lunch&rdquo;</a>. We weren&rsquo;t doing that tonight, however; rather, the plan was to check out two fairly rare live performances from three and two years prior to this masterwork&rsquo;s recording and release, respectively. Both are absolutely fantastic releases, and the latter (a bootleg recording from a show at <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/269401-The-Gaslight">one of Bob Dylan&rsquo;s favorite haunts</a>, pressed into vinyl by Italian bootleggers <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/222849-Ingo">Ingo</a>) is particularly fascinating&ndash;a 1962 unofficial recording with none other than Herbie Hancock himself on piano, playing both with and against Dolphy at various moments. Absolutely worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="august-8-2023----no-show-tonight">August 8, 2023 &ndash; NO SHOW TONIGHT</h3>
<p>Yeaaaah, <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110856954442915341">we were still trying to get out the door.</a>. I had already packed up my decks and comp, and hadn&rsquo;t planned on needing a second pre-record, so I had to call this one in.</p>
<p>Moving on to&hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="august-15-2023----pipers-presumed-birthday--the-yearly-random-birthday-bullshit-epsiode">August 15, 2023 &ndash; Piper&rsquo;s Presumed Birthday &amp; The Yearly Random Birthday Bullshit Epsiode</h3>

  <p>me @ all of you once a year</p>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been weirdly cagey about when <em>exactly</em> my birthday is for so long<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> that I honestly don&rsquo;t remember <em>specifically</em> what day it is, but mid- to late-August is around when I usually claim it happens. And, since is right smack dab in the middle of August, it&rsquo;s time for the Birthday Bullshit episode, in which I bounce around tracks I listened to outside of the confines of jazz and Jazz Program-related activities. <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110895874994561922">Like mentioned over on Masto</a>, don&rsquo;t expect any amount of adherance to genre or cohesion; it&rsquo;s a free-for-all with this one. I also finally managed to set my work computer desk up&ndash;and managed to get myself a setup that let me use my full-sized DJ decks for the first time in years! Needless to say, I <a href="https://datafruits.fm/wiki/chunkin-it">chunked the mix</a> multiple times fiddlin' around with them.</p>

  <summary style="color:#b288dd;">The full track list is a bit long, so I don't want to slap all of the selections smack-dab in the middle of this article, but if you're curious, click here to expand the full playlist.

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, exactly&ndash;maybe I had fallen asleep to a few too many episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 <a href="https://www.gizmoplex.com/mst3k/season:6/videos/mst3k-121-invasionusa">that just so happened to be riffing on Red Scare nonsense</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>&ndash;but for some reason I was in the mood to listen to old timey grumpbags and fake Russian accents. That&rsquo;s exactly what we did on Talkie Time this evening, with &ldquo;The Communist Menace&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prisoners Of The Revolution&rdquo;. Sadly, I couldn&rsquo;t manage to track down the accurate air dates for these two episodes; if you happen to have them, <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">shoot me an email.</a></p>

<p>New month, new silly theme night. Y&rsquo;all already know what it is.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve moved out of our dinky lil' one-bedroom-only-Piper-gets-to-crash-in-the-living-room apartment and into somewhere with an actual two-bedroom setup, I&rsquo;ve finally managed to get my record player, boom box, and other fun things like that set up properly again, which means I&rsquo;ve been back to my old habits of scouring local thrift joints and record shops for rare grooves and tasty sounds. This week, we went through three disks worth of &lsquo;em, found at a local knick-knack shop here in the Quad Cities&ndash;Meg Okura&rsquo;s &ldquo;Las Vegas Tango&rdquo;, Abdullah Ibrahim&rsquo;s &ldquo;Senzo&rdquo;, and the Miki Hayama Trio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wide Angle&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 id="talkie-time--cloak-and-dagger---recommendation-from-rommel--the-roof-of-the-world">Talkie Time : Cloak And Dagger - Recommendation From Rommel / The Roof Of The World</h4>
<p>Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain’s 1946 book “Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS”, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I’ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it’s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren’t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.</p>
<p>While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven’t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s–see also half of James Bond’s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it’s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.</p>

  <p>*slaps roof of car* this bad boy can fit SO much crime in there</p>
</div>
<p>This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and we’ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month’s edition–namely, “Recommendation From Rommel” and “The Roof Of The World”, which aired on August 6 and August 13 respectively in 1950.</p>
<h4 id="the-jazz-program--crime-jazz-night---crime-jazz-volume-1-disks-7--8">The Jazz Program : CRIME JAZZ NIGHT!! - Crime Jazz Volume 1, Disks 7 &amp; 8</h4>
<p>Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don’t know, we’ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We’ll be spinning both disks 7 and 8, letting them play long into the night. Tune in.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s the show lineup for this month! I&rsquo;ll be back soon with next month&rsquo;s radio programming scheddy, as well as the long-overdue Studio Update and Finer Things columns.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve tried exactly two pizza joints here thus far, and thus far the Quad Cities are <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bat_a_thousand">batting a thousand</a>. So yeah, we&rsquo;re off to a great start. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Spoiler alert: we actually had a poll about this <a href="https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed/110933907988780827">over on Mastodon</a> and on the datafruits.fm discord as well. The two potential options were Baguette Night (featuring every album, in order, of the <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Toho_Jazz_Sessions">Toho Jazz Sessions</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://ameblo.jp/ichi-session/">Baguettes Ensemble</a>) or Ultra Lounge Night (featuring the infamous Capitol records series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-Lounge">Ultra Lounge compilation records</a>, in order of release), and the polls were split right down the middle by platform, with Mastodon voting for the funky fumos and the Discord server voting for capital-C cool times. Which one will we go with? Man, I dunno. I&rsquo;ll figure that out when we get to it. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t make archive recordings of my live broadcasts (unless I have to) for two reasons. One, I have pretty bad gender dysphoria about hearing my own voice &ndash;which is weird, considering exactly how much of my career has involved me using that voice for self-expression and for other people&rsquo;s entertainment or amusement. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why so few of my musical endeavours include my vocals as a central feature, that&rsquo;s a large part of why. Two, I tend to view radio as a temporal art form (much like IRL live performance) and very much enjoy that aspect of it. So yeah, no recordings, no rewinds, and no redos. We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_HyZ5aW76c">do it live</a>, son. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>MST3K is one of my favorite &ldquo;have something on in the background to wind down and pass out to&rdquo; shows. I&rsquo;ve probably seen nearly every single episode of seasons one through seven at some point. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
<p>It keeps the weird horoscope gays from badgering me about my star signs. You might think that&rsquo;s a weird reason to go out of one&rsquo;s way to obfuscate an important day in one&rsquo;s life in both public and private, but trust me&ndash;nothing kills the mood like having to explain to a random she/they that no, I can&rsquo;t go ask my mom what time I was born because I don&rsquo;t really <em>have</em> a mom around to ask. And besides, I think randomly getting to say that &ldquo;today&rsquo;s my birthday&rdquo; on days it clearly isn&rsquo;t is funny as hell. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
