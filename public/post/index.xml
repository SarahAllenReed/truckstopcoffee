  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HahaahaAHAAHAA &lt;em&gt;fuck this is late&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. As much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to, I&amp;rsquo;ve not had much time to pen a long column about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to in my spare time, much less had much spare time to spend. Snakes, Barren, and a couple other upcoming projects have kind of monopolized most of my attention, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late on having a second to sit down and write about fun stuff. Hell, &lt;a href=&#34;https://truckstop.coffee/post/0003/&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re skipping an entire month here&lt;/a&gt; cuz I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember what I did in March at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I have listened to a whole lot of new records and watched a bunch of new shows and movies this month&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and very much would like to share &amp;lsquo;em all with you. So, without further ado&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-listening-to&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN LISTENING TO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be a long, long list if I were to type out every sonic novelty that&amp;rsquo;s held my interest over the past three months, but here&amp;rsquo;s a short list of records I&amp;rsquo;ve had blasting on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jonsafari/mocp&#34;&gt;mocp&lt;/a&gt; over the past bit, sorted by the two main places I listen to records&amp;ndash;during my workouts, and in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll be skipping doing Recommended Tracks for the &amp;ldquo;Workout Jamz&amp;rdquo; section, primarily because I was listening to each record/mix the whole way through while pumping iron or doing cardio and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to pick out individual tracks for you to check out. Still recommend you check out each record in their entirety, though, regardless of which list they&amp;rsquo;re on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workout-jamz&#34;&gt;WORKOUT JAMZ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_01.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Freetube logo.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Literally the only thing I&#39;ve found to make Youtube consistently usable on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the roads aren&amp;rsquo;t (consistently)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; prohibitively snowy, I&amp;rsquo;ve been finally able to hit the gym with some sort of actual consistency again. And, as a direct result, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of longer mixes, re-visiting some old favorites, and generally putting on two hours worth of either mixes or variations upon a theme of podcasts while I do fifteen reps of my body weight on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sus+machine&#34;&gt;sus machine&lt;/a&gt; and try to avoid cute muscle boys catching me checking them out so I don&amp;rsquo;t get the fuck kicked out of me in the locker room. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this list are gonna be accompanied by Youtube links&amp;ndash;the sets don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available anywhere else that I could find, although I refuse to use Spotify &lt;a href=&#34;https://jacobin.com/2020/12/spotify-streaming-model-exploitation-class-conflict&#34;&gt;for obvious reasons&lt;/a&gt; so they may be on there. I should point out that, when on the move ,I either use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sus+machine&#34;&gt;Newpipe&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; if I have my spare Android device with me or &lt;a href=&#34;https://sxmo.org/&#34;&gt;sxmo&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; if I have my Pinephone to snag them. In the studio, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://freetubeapp.io/&#34;&gt;Freetube&lt;/a&gt;, which has the added boon of allowing you to pipe through &lt;a href=&#34;https://invidious.io/&#34;&gt;Invidious&lt;/a&gt; rather than going through the Friendly Panopticon&amp;rsquo;s servers directly. Privacy is important and so is making local archive copies of things you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mala---boiler-room-london&#34;&gt;MALA - BOILER ROOM LONDON&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkgik4edDpY&#34;&gt;This set&lt;/a&gt; is legendary for a reason, and not just because it&amp;rsquo;s one of the only times Mala has appeared on video during a live mix, much less had his mixing wizardry recorded at all. Ample &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/cuepoint/wheel-it-up-history-of-the-rewind-21fdcff243d9&#34;&gt;rewinds&lt;/a&gt;, an insane track list, and a level of bass that almost necessitates a full stack, if not an entire sound system proper&amp;ndash;this set has it all, and Mala spins the entire thing dancing along with the audience. Fantastic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Peter Cullen posing with Optimus Prime.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; When you get this guy to voice the intro to your D&amp;B album, you know you&#39;ve made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dieselboy---the-dungeonmasters-guide&#34;&gt;DIESELBOY - THE DUNGEONMASTER&amp;rsquo;S GUIDE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to this in almost a decade, and put it on basically on a whim. Unsurprisingly, it still rips. A masterpiece of aggressive drum-and-bass paired with a fantastic selection of samples (including Red Queen&amp;rsquo;s monologue from the Resident Evil movie on the track &amp;lsquo;Infection (E-Sassin&amp;rsquo; mix)&#39;) as well as an introduction from Optimus Prime himself (Peter Cullen), this whole record is a treasure trove for the specific type of dork that spins records back because she &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; she heard that sample somewhere else before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s me. I am that specific type of dork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Soul Cowboy cover art&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; IIIIIINDAaaaAASTREEETS! HIT-ME-IN-DA- STREEEEEEETZ!!!11 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;skinny-puppy---the-greater-wrong-of-the-right&#34;&gt;SKINNY PUPPY - THE GREATER WRONG OF THE RIGHT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, and again mostly on a whim, I decided to search out an old music video I watched back when I was younger. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwhK9nfFhMU&#34;&gt;It still holds up as one of the greatest music videos I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the tune slapped as well, and I put it on the Jazz Program as bump music for a bit. Looked it up while in the gym for a bit, and it turns out the rest of the album slaps as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it described as their &amp;ldquo;most accessible&amp;rdquo;, and seeing as I tend to turn off most industrial records halfway through, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of glad for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;amorphis---queen-of-time&#34;&gt;AMORPHIS - QUEEN OF TIME&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you gotta get back to your roots, man. I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding it weirdly difficult to listen to black metal since Ophelia Drowning went kaput and The Forest At Night left Radio Dark Tunnel&amp;rsquo;s lineup. Something about it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t give me the good brain chemicals it used to, and if anything hearing genres I used to try (and repeatedly fail) to be a part of the community of kind of just makes me depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Amorphis hits nowhere near that mark, especially their later stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;d get endless amounts of flack for this were I to put this comment in some kind of metal forum or what-have-you, but &amp;ldquo;Queen Of Time&amp;rdquo; specifically hits a lot of the same notes for me as the post-hardcore and melodic metalcore I listened to growing up. Combine that with some heavy-hitting lyrics about love, loss, and overcoming obstacles on one&amp;rsquo;s journey, and yeah. This is something I can bench to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hybrid Minds.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Soulful D&amp;B&#39;s greatest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hybrid-minds---bbc-radio-1-essential-mix&#34;&gt;HYBRID MINDS - BBC RADIO 1 ESSENTIAL MIX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Minds are gods. If you consider yourself to be among the throngs of little faith, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/GpyMU6xrcDA&#34;&gt;go check out this set&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000m0j8&#34;&gt;peep the tracklist.&lt;/a&gt; You cannot find a more energizing, enrapturing, and borderline spiritual set of soulful tunes and smooth, divine track transitions without just heading back ten years to the age of classics like Oakenfold&amp;rsquo;s Goa mix. Perfect for doing kettlebell work, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;soft-machine---third&#34;&gt;SOFT MACHINE - THIRD&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, we all have days when we&amp;rsquo;re in &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; moods. My weird mood days just happen to have me staring off into the æther while I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFk3RzndUEc&#34;&gt;leg press&lt;/a&gt; twice my body weight as &amp;lsquo;Slightly All The Time&amp;rsquo; wails into my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not telling you this is a bad album. It&amp;rsquo;s a certifiable classic. I&amp;rsquo;m also not going to sit here and get oddly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/braggadocious&#34;&gt;braggadocious&lt;/a&gt; about how &amp;ldquo;lol i&amp;rsquo;m so edgy&amp;rdquo; for listening to avant-garde tripe in inappropriate places, because I made enough of those in my mid-twenties when I was dumb enough to think I was cool. I&amp;rsquo;m just autistic as all hell, and sometimes I have Bad Brain Days and need the Weird Noises to accompany me on my bold journey to having a thicker ass than half the cisgendered cardio bunnies in this here Planny Fitty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;studio-jamz&#34;&gt;STUDIO JAMZ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a weird one, because half the time in the studio I&amp;rsquo;m putting on the same exact records I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to for most of my career, especially if I need to get my brain into &amp;ldquo;work mode&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With that stated, once I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; work mode, I&amp;rsquo;ll put on a variety of records&amp;ndash;either stuff I plan on featuring on the radio, records I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about or heard tracks from on other radio shows that I&amp;rsquo;d like to check out&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or old records I love that I just want to hear again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t list the last one here&amp;ndash;my &amp;ldquo;comfort food&amp;rdquo; in the studio could take up seven or more installments worth of five thousand word columns&amp;ndash;but here&amp;rsquo;s a few interesting samples and selections from the first two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover art to The Glow, Pt. 2.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This lil&#39; elephant here knows how to tug at my heartstrings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-microphones---the-glow-pt-2&#34;&gt;THE MICROPHONES - THE GLOW, PT. 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the past few months, I jokingly told an old friend of mine about a great new black metal record I thought they should check out. That record was &amp;ldquo;The Glow, Pt. 2&amp;rdquo;, and I was only half being a jackass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microphones hit a lot of the notes that got me into DSBM and post-black metal in the first place, both emotionally and sonically, and I&amp;rsquo;d unironically rank it up there with (and in borderline the same category as) Agalloch&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Mantle&amp;rdquo; or Lifelover&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pulver&amp;rdquo; as far as records go. This entire record is a beautiful and devastating emotional rollercoaster, and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended Tracks: All of &amp;lsquo;em. The piece doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work if you don&amp;rsquo;t listen to the whole thing cover to cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/music_05.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/music_05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover art to Fire Of Unknown Origin.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Plus, this record features cover art by Rolling Stone&#39;s own &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/artist/2235781-Greg-Scott-8&#34;&gt;Greg Scott.&lt;/a&gt; What&#39;s not to love? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;blue-öyster-cult---fire-of-unknown-origin&#34;&gt;BLUE ÖYSTER CULT - FIRE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Yeah, I know. No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never sat down and listened to &amp;ldquo;Fire Of Unknown Origin&amp;rdquo; until this month. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m just as surprised as you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I can say about this one that hasn&amp;rsquo;t already been said. It&amp;rsquo;s either up there with or takes the top spot of BOC&amp;rsquo;s best records, depending on who you ask, and the whole thing is a nerdy, energizing, and generally wonderful record. If I had never &amp;ldquo;gotten&amp;rdquo; BOC before now, this would be the record that would have made their style click, and seeing as the record that made them click for me was &amp;ldquo;Agents Of Fortune&amp;rdquo;, this is just more of what I liked from that album, cranked up a notch or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended Tracks: Burnin&amp;rsquo; For You, Fire Of Unknown Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Stretchiest trumpet in the world, right here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chief-xian-atunde-adjuah-christian-scott---stretch-music&#34;&gt;CHIEF XIAN ATUNDE ADJUAH (CHRISTIAN SCOTT) - STRETCH MUSIC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hooooly fuck. I heard &amp;lsquo;Perspectives&amp;rsquo; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuvo.org&#34;&gt;KUVO&lt;/a&gt; this month, and I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to track this record down. I have been trying for what seems like my entire life to find more records that scratch at or near the itch that listening to early The Mars Volta records at a formative age have just kind of left there, and&amp;hellip;yeah. Did not expect that void to be filled by a trumpeter from NOLA, but here we are. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely be spending a good amount of time with the good Chief&amp;rsquo;s music over the next month or so, because the rest of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from him is equally as fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended Tracks: Perspectives, Sunrise in Beijing (feat. Elena Pinderhughes), Tantric&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; I don&#39;t know who did cover art duties for this one, but whoever &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt;, did a helluva job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-lyman-woodard-organization---saturday-night-specialdont-stop-the-groove&#34;&gt;THE LYMAN WOODARD ORGANIZATION - SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL/DON&amp;rsquo;T STOP THE GROOVE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN IN DESPAIR&lt;br&gt;
DON&amp;rsquo;T TAKE TO THE AIR&lt;br&gt;
SIT DOWN AND FEEL&lt;br&gt;
WHAT YOU KNOW IS REEEEEAL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpwLwzngFtc&#34;&gt;YEEEAAAH, YEAH, YEAAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;.that&amp;rsquo;s it, that&amp;rsquo;s all I got here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, lyric quotes aside, go listen to Lyman Woodard. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how one can listen to his records and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feel the urge to dance and create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended Tracks: Creative Musicians, Don&amp;rsquo;t Stop The Groove, Theme In Search Of A Sportspectacular&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-playing&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN PLAYING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much, honestly. Since, again, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to sit down and faff about, I&amp;rsquo;ve been sticking to either games that I can turn my brain off to or games that I absolutely need a walkthrough of some manner for because I&amp;rsquo;m too stupid to figure out the inner workings of the game designer&amp;rsquo;s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contain multitudes, dammit. Multitudes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/game_01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/game_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot from The Case Of The Golden Idol.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; oh dear me yes it seems the Old Time Troubles are here in our humble village yet again &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-the-golden-idol&#34;&gt;THE CASE OF THE GOLDEN IDOL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SmxX_nazCs&#34;&gt;Supergreatfriend&lt;/a&gt; tried this one out for an hour a while back, and after sitting there screaming the puzzle solutions at the screen I decided to give it a shot to see if I&amp;rsquo;d have any better luck than he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for the first few puzzles, yes. Yes I did. The issues comes later, where the designers force the clues to compound between cases and require you to remember who&amp;rsquo;s who and which face goes with which person&amp;hellip;which would be fine if &lt;em&gt;how the characters are drawn was consistent between chapters,&lt;/em&gt; which is hit and miss at best. It&amp;rsquo;s a minor detail, but very much something that can be hair-rippingly frustrating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conquests-of-the-longbow&#34;&gt;CONQUESTS OF THE LONGBOW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/game_02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/game_02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot from Conquests Of The Longbow.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This scene, specifically, stuck with me. And not just because &#34;dancing in an enchanted forest in a gorgeous nightgown to an audience of my one true love and the creatures of the forest&#34; is what you could politely call my transition goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. One of the first Sierra games to feature in full VGA color, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sierra_Entertainment_video_games&#34;&gt;if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; first depending on how you calculate it&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;the previous in-house game was Quest For Glory II, which featured EGA graphics and a text parser&amp;ndash;and somehow they managed to &lt;em&gt;nail&lt;/em&gt; it right out of the fuckin&amp;rsquo; gate. The art is painterly yet restrained, the character portraits are beautiful and portray emotions remarkably well given the limitations present in both hardware and experience, and there are entire scenes that are just &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt; in their beauty. Old-school Sierra were always masters of romanticism and fairy-tale universes, but it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see how a simple color-palette upgrade takes it all to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How&amp;rsquo;s the gameplay? Well&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s a Sierra point and click. Does it still include its fair share of Sierra bullshit? Absolutely. But if you can look past the moon logic, figure out how to work the strange mouse navigation from screen to screen, and if you remembered to track down a copy of the manual&amp;ndash;also beautifully illustrated, because of course it is, but as is tradition &lt;em&gt;your ass is not getting past the copy protection without it&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s a remarkably enjoyable point-and-click with some of the most memorable graphics I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen from this era.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; IT ME FR FR  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I&amp;rsquo;m a simple dipshit, aaight? I see a game about goblins throwing rocks, and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;status as the undisputed Queen of Goblins&lt;/a&gt; legally requires me to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blame &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTvwKQHVid4YRvZnyLfCoNQ6lFtahFNrr&#34;&gt;Kikoskia&lt;/a&gt; for this one. I have his VODs and Let&amp;rsquo;s Plays going fairly often for background noise while I&amp;rsquo;m in the studio, and he picked up this game at some point in the past month. I saw it, picked it up, and haven&amp;rsquo;t really put it down since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still in Early Access, unfortunately, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of little bits and bobs either missing or outright broken. Hell, there&amp;rsquo;s a couple treasures you can pick up whose text outright doesn&amp;rsquo;t display for me on the version I have. With that stated, the art&amp;rsquo;s charming, the concept is simple and has an addicting gameplay loop, and the sound design (especially the final boss theme) is immaculate. Highly recommend snagging it if you enjoy simple arcade romps, plinky pachinko boards, or deck-builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gonna be real with you here. I don&amp;rsquo;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s Always Sunny In The J. Edgar Hoover Building: The Gang Finds Mulder&#39;s Porno &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrilege, I know, but I genuinely can&amp;rsquo;t get the appeal. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch it in its heyday, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I expected to be able to take it seriously than I clearly was able to, and maybe it gets good after Season 1. But on god, half these episodes are god-awful (notable examples&amp;ndash;which I will not be calling by their actual names&amp;ndash;include S1E5 &amp;ldquo;Mulder Has A Cavewoman Fetish&amp;rdquo;, S1E8 &amp;ldquo;Hey Skully, You Ever Seen &amp;lsquo;The Thing&amp;rsquo;? No? Well This&amp;rsquo;ll All Be New To You Then&amp;rdquo;, and S1E9 &amp;ldquo;Oh No, There&amp;rsquo;s A Spoopy Face On The Moon, Time For A Second Challenger Disaster&amp;rdquo;) and the other half are only vaguely interesting (S1E3 &amp;ldquo;OH GOD ITS IN THE WALLS ITS IN THE WALLS ITSINTHEFUCKINWALLS&amp;rdquo;, S1E2 &amp;ldquo;It Turns Out That If Your Dumbass Partner Breaks Into A Top Secret Black Site You Can Just Point A Gun At The Cops To Get Him Back, Trust Me Bruh, They Won&amp;rsquo;t Shoot You, It&amp;rsquo;s Chill&amp;rdquo;, and S1E6 &amp;ldquo;The Case Of The Haunted Desk Plaquard With A Ben Franklin Quote&amp;rdquo; being the most &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; examples).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; schlock pulp teevee, dammit. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the TV adaptation of La Femme Nikita, I have the complete run of the 2001 Witchblade show on my hard drive, and I have both Total Recall and Eraser in my VHS library. Hell, I almost prefer the trash &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130416/&#34;&gt;1990s Mike Hammer reboot&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086760/episodes?season=1&#34;&gt;the &amp;rsquo;80s run&lt;/a&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s nearly explicitly because I think the idea of &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s No Way She&amp;rsquo;s Not A Body Snatcher Because No One Stays Lookin&amp;rsquo; That Young That Long&amp;rdquo; Velda and &amp;ldquo;Young Troubled Boy We Brought Onto The Show Because It&amp;rsquo;s The Nineties, Maaaan&amp;rdquo; Nick trying to teach &amp;ldquo;Definitely Not A Body Snatcher Because Holy Shit He&amp;rsquo;s Aged Fifty Years Since We Saw Him In The Eighties&amp;rdquo; Old Man Stacy Keach how to use the computer is funny as shit. The schlock ain&amp;rsquo;t the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/tv_02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/tv_02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot from The X-Files.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Man, I didn&#39;t even cherry pick this one. This is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(The_X-Files)&#34;&gt;straight up off the Wikipedia page for the ninth episode from this season.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the root of the issue seems to be that the writers &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; want me to take it far more seriously than I&amp;rsquo;m even remotely able to, and at the same time it doesn&amp;rsquo;t play what tongue-in-cheek humor it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have evenly enough for it to work. I basically clocked out right at S1E11 after skipping half of the previous few episodes midway through because I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it, and seeing as S1E14 is literally called &amp;ldquo;Gender Bender&amp;rdquo; and I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine they&amp;rsquo;re gonna play &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hand with any subtlety or compassion&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my trans ass is almost &lt;em&gt;glad&lt;/em&gt; I skipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, despite on paper being the target demographic for it, I just cannot seem to grok S1 of X-Files. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll start in on Season 2 at some point and it&amp;rsquo;ll be more tolerable. Hell, if anyone has any advice on exactly when in S1 it starts getting tolerable, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; and let me know. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it another college try at some point. But right now&amp;hellip;nah man, I&amp;rsquo;m good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and speaking of Mike Hammer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;mike-hammer-1990s-season-1&#34;&gt;MIKE HAMMER (1990s) (SEASON 1)&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s Always Sunny In New York: The Gang Watches Internet Porno. Yes, I know I just made that gag, but that&#39;s unironically what the third episode is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;guess what I&amp;rsquo;ve been making Autumn ████████ watch during Studio Movie Night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 90s run of Mike Hammer, as I briefly touched up above in my rant about Scully and Mulder&amp;rsquo;s Sexual Tension Adventures, is &lt;em&gt;balls to the wall 90&amp;rsquo;s as fuck.&lt;/em&gt; Like a good amount of reboots in the nineties (&amp;ldquo;Escape From LA&amp;rdquo; immediately comes to mind, and not just because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116225/fullcredits&#34;&gt;Stacy Keach also plays Commander Malloy in that one&lt;/a&gt;), the 90&amp;rsquo;s run of Spillaine&amp;rsquo;s signature big ugly bastard plops the best actor to have ever played the role out of the gritty &amp;rsquo;80s of his previous appearance and directly into the Brave New World of cable news, Internet porn, and b-ball. I&amp;rsquo;m not just pulling those tropes from a hat with the words &amp;ldquo;things the 90s had lying around&amp;rdquo; written on it, by the way&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130416/episodes?season=1&#34;&gt;those are literally the Big Bads of episodes 2-4 of Season 1, respectively.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s campy-ass nonsense complete with requisite gruff pulp monologue narration from Keach himself, and while the topics retain the same level of grit as you would expect from a Spillaine-inspired romp&amp;ndash;the Internet porn episode&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;final boss&amp;rdquo; is a snuff film ring&amp;ndash;it does not for a second expect you to take it with any gravitas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;harvey-birdman-seasons-1-3&#34;&gt;HARVEY BIRDMAN (SEASONS 1-3)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/tv_04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/tv_04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Harvey Birdman and Steven Colbert&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Would it surprise you to learn these two are the same person? ...No? Yeah me neither anyways moving on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been tuning in early to my three-hour block on Tuesday nights over on [datafruits.fm], you probably know that I tend to test my connection to the radio server by doing a small segment loosely called &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;until then, here&amp;rsquo;s this.&amp;rdquo; I usually have a few minutes before Talkie Time and between Talkie Time and The Jazz Program each week, and I tend to fill said minutes with random tracks interspersed with stupid TV and movie quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably also might have noticed me sampling Harvey Birdman a lot. If so, that&amp;rsquo;s because Autumn&amp;rsquo;s retaliation for me making her watch Mike Hammer learn what cable is was to make me watch Steven Colbert play a washed-up superhero-turned-lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a few episodes that get uncomfortable in that &amp;ldquo;early Adult Swim&amp;rdquo; kind of way&amp;ndash;S3E9 &amp;ldquo;The Return Of Birdgirl&amp;rdquo; is a notable one, as the writers stumble their way through attempting to comment on legalizing gay marriage and somehow manage to fuck up so badly that it almost seems like they&amp;rsquo;re equating gay marriage to incest&amp;ndash;but all in all, the series holds up as well as shit like Sealab 2021, Space Ghost Coast To Coast, and other early AS romps, while using its 13-and-a-half-ish minute time limit to not overstay its welcome in each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autumn-and-sarahs-big-dumb-movie-night&#34;&gt;AUTUMN AND SARAH&amp;rsquo;S BIG DUMB MOVIE NIGHT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Autumn ████████&#39;s schedule and my constantly being vaguely busy, our little studio/found family doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to sit down and do much together that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve working on shit these days. We do, however, try and find time to have some kinda movie night every so often, and we tend to strike a happy medium between her preference for off-the-wall nonsense and my firm love for shite action garbage. Note that a good portion of these selections should not be taken as reflections of our taste&amp;ndash;the two of us have a tendency to just pick shit that will actively annoy the other.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve had on over the past bit. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving out some of the ones we watched, as well as a bunch of the movies I watched in the gym during cardio, because&amp;hellip;well, I&amp;rsquo;m running out of space here. Most of the ones I&amp;rsquo;m leaving out were movies I watch every so often because I love &amp;lsquo;em, so they&amp;rsquo;ll come back at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;punisher-warzone&#34;&gt;PUNISHER: WARZONE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly expected this to be bad. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/movie_01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/movie_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot from Punisher: War Zone.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; FUCK THIS GUY IN PARTICULAR &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autumn sold me on this&amp;rsquo;n by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xop8yqgDMo4&#34;&gt;describing a scene in which Frank Castle straight up lights up a drugged up dude doing parkour with what looks like a surface-to-air missle&lt;/a&gt;, and that hit &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many Bullshit Action Movie Points for me that, in my hubris, I demanded we fill at least one movie night slot with this tripe. I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; it would be complete trash going in. Combine the mid-2000s tendency to make action flicks in general &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/yujF8AumiQo?t=26&#34;&gt;overly edgy for no good reason&lt;/a&gt; with it being an early superhero film&amp;ndash;one that features Frank Fuckin&amp;rsquo; Castle, to boot, the king of Edgy McEdgelordbait&amp;ndash;and I was expecting &lt;em&gt;garbage&lt;/em&gt;, sure, but &lt;em&gt;entertaining&lt;/em&gt; garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah, man. This flick&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em&gt;fuckin&amp;rsquo; dull.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even the action scenes constantly find themselves batting in the low .100s when they&amp;rsquo;re not fouling out or swinging into embarrassing strikes. The closest thing this film had going for it was the obvious queer-coded (and, I&amp;rsquo;d argue, borderline reclaimable as trans-coded&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) duo of Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim, and the most hilarious part of that is that not only does the movie fail to even manage to make the &amp;ldquo;villian&amp;rdquo; part of &amp;ldquo;queer coded villain&amp;rdquo; trope stick&amp;ndash;the scene where Frank Castle tosses the mobster into a glass crusher and fucks up his face bad enough to turn him into Jigsaw is so unreasonably brutal and fucked up that you honestly kind of empathize with the guy for wanting to fuck up Angry Cop Mans&amp;ndash;but it &lt;em&gt;makes them more interesting than the title character himself&lt;/em&gt;. Frank Castle is &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;, and spends half the film being an self-hating little whinebag when he&amp;rsquo;s not busy getting his ass handed to him or somehow manage to bumble his way into slaughtering rooms full of what I assume we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to take as &amp;ldquo;bad guys&amp;rdquo; by the virtue of the writers blatantly ignoring how modern arms work in favor of The Rule Of Cool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Screenshot from Punisher: War Zo....oh wait no this is from a much better movie nvm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even The Rule Of Cool doesn&amp;rsquo;t save this film here&amp;ndash;while writing this, I actually completely confused one of the action scenes in this movie &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkA1aPN9C0A&#34;&gt;with the staircase scene from Shoot &amp;lsquo;Em Up.&lt;/a&gt;, and got halfway through writing about a &amp;ldquo;staircase scene&amp;rdquo; before realizing I was confusing one edgy hyperviolent movie about an angry maladjusted white guy shooting his way through multiple cartoonishly evil villans and entire mobs worth of gangsters in order to protect a woman and child with another, slightly better movie with a nearly identical premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you wanna watch a movie about a maladjusted angry guy shooting people he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like, just watch Shoot &amp;lsquo;Em Up. It&amp;rsquo;s not good either, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s at least &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; fun, and you won&amp;rsquo;t get bullied by people who think it&amp;rsquo;s funny that they tricked you into watching a Punisher movie. &lt;em&gt;Looking at you, Autumn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-matrix&#34;&gt;THE MATRIX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I had never seen The Matrix until this year when Autumn pulled it up for movie night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was okay. I guess I get a lot of pop culture references now. The fight scenes were great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t remember most of it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;hellip;boy howdy between this and my opinion of the x-files i&amp;rsquo;m gonna get some aaaaangry emails aren&amp;rsquo;t i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;john-wick-1-2--3-parabellum&#34;&gt;JOHN WICK 1, 2, &amp;amp; 3: PARABELLUM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Wick 4 hit theaters relatively recently, and while both of us wanted to go see it, Autumn had only seen 1 and 3 and I had only seen 2. So, we decided to just sit down one night and watch all three before booking tickets to 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already burned way too many words on Being Angry At Frank Castle&amp;rsquo;s Big Gay NYC Adventure, so in order to prevent me from &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/044/247/297.png&#34;&gt;screaming at clouds&lt;/a&gt; once we get deep enough into this, I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna sum these up in one paragraph each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;john-wick-1&#34;&gt;JOHN WICK 1&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the best action film of its era, but pretty high up there. Wick 1 suffers from some pacing issues, especially in the first half, but they&amp;rsquo;re the kind of pacing issues you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a movie that knows full well that it only gets two hours or so of runtime, and while it speedruns through most of Wick&amp;rsquo;s motivations it does in fact let you see where they take him in violent, bloody fights with fantastic choreography and a choice selection of obscenely beautiful shots. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the Wick series called &amp;ldquo;Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s answer to John Woo&amp;rdquo;, and it does its best to set the stage for that here, especially in its fantastic final fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;john-wick-2&#34;&gt;JOHN WICK 2&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and the best of the three as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. The homage to kung-fu cinema is even more blatant here&amp;ndash;the use of what looks like a green screen close-up with heavy color grading and heavy vignetting just before the subway fight scene with Cassian &lt;em&gt;screams&lt;/em&gt; Hong Kong cinema to me&amp;ndash;and key concepts such as the Continental are introduced here, which both flesh out the blood-covered world Wick inhabits and makes it incredibly fascinating. This is also where a lot of cracks in the armor start to show as well, unfortunately&amp;ndash;the complete lack of music or other audio during the Cassian fight, while atmospheric, makes the fight drag on just a little too long, which is something the third movie &lt;em&gt;drags into the ground&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;but all and all this is the best Wick film in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;john-wick-3-parabellum&#34;&gt;JOHN WICK 3: PARABELLUM&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I lied. I can&amp;rsquo;t keep this to one paragraph. I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;mad&lt;/em&gt; at this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/movie_04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/movie_04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;John Wick skin from Fortnite.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;HI YES I&#39;M ADDY JUDICATER FROM HR AND I BET YOUR WONDERING WHY I CALLED YOU ALL TO THIS ZOOM CALL TODAY&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autumn jokingly described this one as &amp;ldquo;the movie where they deal with the consequences of the first two&amp;rdquo;, and she&amp;rsquo;s right. The issue is that the consequences are introduced way too quickly and often end up on express trains to Nowhere Land before derailing and crashing just before shit could have gotten even remotely interesting, and then it spends half the film dealing with the assassin&amp;rsquo;s equivalent of an insurance claims agent bitching at everyone to pay up because god forbid your liability policy covers &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film tosses a lot of interesting (Sofia, Berrada), not-so-interesting (John Wick Fanboy Guy Whose Name I Forgot), and, occasionally, insufferable (The Adjudicator) characters at you, and then barely does anything with the good ones and drags the insufferable ones (&lt;em&gt;LIKE THE ADJUDICATOR&lt;/em&gt;) across your face like a teabag by a greasy frat boy who&amp;rsquo;s been training to hold a squat as long as possible for the explicit reason that he enjoys teabagging people (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAVE I IMPLIED HARD ENOUGH THAT I FUCKIN HATE THE ADJUDICATOR YET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of The Adjudicator, the universe&amp;ndash;especially the enigmatic High Table&amp;ndash;is fleshed out rapid-fire, and the film teaches you that the High Table it fleshes out both sucks and is mired in weird bullshit that also sucks. It introduces this tiny shaven goth lady called The Adjudicator as The High Table&amp;rsquo;s token representative for the movie, and it spends &lt;em&gt;half the film&lt;/em&gt; making you watch every single person the previous two films built up as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;literal gods in a world of hired killers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pissing themselves at the prospect of having to deal with what appears to be nothing more than one hundred and ten pounds of cranky art school dropout turned HR Auditor. It also teaches you that John Wick&amp;ndash;you know, the guy the first two movies set up as basically the second coming of Assassin Jesus? The Baba Yaga? Fortnite Battle Royale Numbah One?&amp;ndash;is a little bitch when faced with even the &lt;em&gt;prospect&lt;/em&gt; of dealing with the High Table, a writing choice which, again, is complete bullshit, weird as hell, and really sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight scenes are mostly great, but every second one seems to take the &amp;ldquo;no music&amp;rdquo; thing that pushed the Cassian fight in the second film just &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; into insufferable territory, then tosses the engine into first gear and drags its fuckin&amp;rsquo; cargo up a steep grade at an unbearably slow pace. Any concept of shot consistency is more or less gone. A particularly egregious example is the upstairs fight scene with John Wick Fanboy, which is just the mirror fight from 2 but way too fuckin&amp;rsquo; long, no actual continuity, almost no music, and the opposing player to Wick being basically Banderas&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=howhfMAoEt0&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Wanna Be Number One&amp;rdquo; character gimmick from &amp;ldquo;Assassins&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; but simultaneously without the off-the-rails insanity that made Banderas&amp;rsquo;s character work and borderline Jokerfied in his fanboyism. Fact is, when your fights are topping ten minutes plus at the high end of their runtime,  often lack music entirely, make it impossible for the audience to follow what&amp;rsquo;s going on, re-use gimmicks from previous films with barely any actual iteration on the themes, and feature dull, unlikable characters, &lt;em&gt;that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t add up to what I expect from a franchise like John Wick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/movie_05.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/movie_05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;John Wick skin from Fortnite.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;I&#39;d tell you this was about when I started screaming but I&#39;m gonna be real, I just paused it and stared at the screen for like ten seconds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be completely frank, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all of this almost redeems itself at the end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The Continental fight is one of the best in the series. Winston putting Vivaldi on the loudspeakers is an immaculate brushstroke, the fight fleshes out Charon and Winston quite a bit&amp;ndash;which is great! they&amp;rsquo;re two of the most interesting characters in this universe!&amp;ndash;and despite making you suffer through the aforementioned mirror fight at some point during all this, the whole shebang ends with The Adjudicator throwing in the towel and coming to the table to negotiate. All would be fine if the living embodiment of &amp;ldquo;Do You Know Who My Daddy Boss Is&amp;rdquo; got her comeuppance at the end of the film, and we come real fuckin&amp;rsquo; close to that happening and this film closing out with a satisfying ending. Hell, maybe toss her off the roof to send a message to The High Table. That&amp;rsquo;d be fun. But, despite a huge shootout to defend The Continental against her bullshit, our boys Winston and Charon just acquiesce to her and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;toss John off the roof instead out of almost nowhere and for basically no previously broadcast reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, giving John WIck 3 the most anticlimactic bullshit ending this side of Lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, I vetoed watching John Wick 4 in theaters after 3. We&amp;rsquo;re waiting &amp;lsquo;till it leaves theaters and watching it in the studio. Lord knows we do not need to get kicked out of &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; theater due to me screaming at the screen, and seeing as the end of the third film sees My Least Favorite Character getting her way and The Continental tossing Keanu out on his ass and into Ya Boy Morpheus&amp;rsquo;s sewers, I don&amp;rsquo;t even think focusing on Lawrence &amp;amp; Keanu&amp;rsquo;s Excellent Adventures will make me think dropping thirty bucks on tickets and a tenner on popcorn will be worth it if Assassin HR Lawyer Team Girl is back for a second round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to this in six months or however long it takes for this thing to get out of theaters and onto my smaller screen. And yeah, you bet your &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m probably gonna have Opinions on that one as well. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-rock&#34;&gt;THE ROCK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a fan theory going around that states that Sean Connery&amp;rsquo;s character in Michael Bay&amp;rsquo;s The Rock, James Mason, isn&amp;rsquo;t who he says he is. In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FdnevXjqdc&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of evidence that&amp;ndash;while not official in any capacity&amp;ndash;points to Mason actually being Connery&amp;rsquo;s last role as James Bond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you can imagine why I demanded this be a movie night selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/movie_06.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/movie_06.gif&#34; alt=&#34;John Wick skin from Fortnite.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;thank you sean connery, very cool&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue this film has is the exact same one that Punisher: War Zone had, but in reverse&amp;ndash;the only two things this film has going for it is Connery in the role of Mason and Nick Cage in a lead role as bomb disposal expert Dr. Stanley Goodspeed. The villians suck, the supporting cast is mid, and the plot is nonsense. Every single thing this film has going for it is driven by these two powerhouses, and nearly every quotable or memorable scene is either because they&amp;rsquo;re both damn good at their jobs or because Michael Bay&amp;ndash;even this early in his career&amp;ndash;is laughably and demonstrably shit at his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in fairness, this is signs of peak Bay. Let&amp;rsquo;s be real here: you don&amp;rsquo;t watch a Michael Bay film because you expect it to be good. You don&amp;rsquo;t watch it because you expect a full cast of interesting and well-developed characters. No, you watch Explosions McBullshit Mans Brand Films to see one or two insane but entertaining dorks bumbling their way through  awkward interactions with what few women are in the film, inane and often ham-fisted plot twists, unreasonably high stakes driven by certifiable and irredeemable villains who get way more screen time and backstory than they really deserve, and explosions. Lots of explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that, The Rock delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised you all some insights on my reading list last time, and never let anyone say I don&amp;rsquo;t deliver, even if it takes me a bit longer than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Jack Reachers In Screenshot May Be Larger Than They Appear&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lee-child---killing-floor&#34;&gt;LEE CHILD - KILLING FLOOR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Reacher is a man after my own heart. His interests include diners, blues, old cars, sex, and blowing off the heads of the local rich goon&amp;rsquo;s lackeys with stolen Ithicas. Add into that the fact that he&amp;rsquo;s six-foot-five and is built like a brick shithouse (and ignore the fact that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what commitment is) and he&amp;rsquo;d be the type of man that I&amp;rsquo;d have trouble keeping &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of my heart as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.redd.it/7bl5i42gd02b1.png&#34;&gt;I have a type.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Killing Floor is the first released full book in the series, and it established the character as a force to be reckoned with in the modern noir canon for a reason. The book starts strong, with honestly one of the best opening lines in recent memory (&amp;ldquo;I was arrested in Eno&amp;rsquo;s diner&amp;rdquo;) and doesn&amp;rsquo;t let up from there. Lee Child paints a fantastically in-depth portrait of a man who both never really gave up the war and never really gave up on his freedom, either, and the supporting cast is fantastic and painted as boldly as any strokes from the masters like Spillane would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of The Man Himself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hey look, it&#39;s that guy from Escape From LA! ...no wait hold on&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mickey-spillane---i-the-jury&#34;&gt;MICKEY SPILLANE - I, THE JURY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;I also spent some time revisiting his masterstrokes. Managed to snag a copy of The Complete Mike Hammer, and &amp;ldquo;I, The Jury&amp;rdquo; was Selection Numero Uno. It&amp;rsquo;s a strong start. All the notes one would expect from the biggest, ugliest leading beast in dime store crime are hit&amp;ndash;dead friends, colorful allies, dangerous goons, and seditious, murderous dames are all present. The climax of the book is honestly one of the best in Spillane&amp;rsquo;s catalogue as well, as a country club full of a rogues gallery that would intimidate even Poirot turns into a bloody routing of the murderer and the finale of the who-dunnit as all the remaining suspects lay dead and the final culprit turns out to be the one closest to the heart. It&amp;rsquo;s a knockout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;john-lecarre---the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold&#34;&gt;JOHN LECARRE - THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-read this every year, and every year I turn up something new. John LeCarre is a romantic in the purest form, which makes his subject&amp;ndash;the ins and outs of global espionage&amp;ndash;all the more intruiging in how he paints it. &amp;ldquo;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&amp;rdquo; is a prime example of his unique touch, as the damned Leamas finds himself falling out of love with his country and in love with a Party member. She saves him from himself, he saves her from the hands of the bloodiest man in communist Berlin, and in the end none of it matters in a climax that still takes its place as one of the bleakest in spy fiction. If you ever wonder why everything I write is a love story at its core no matter the subject&amp;hellip;here&amp;rsquo;s where I get it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tom-clancy---patriot-games-the-hunt-for-red-october&#34;&gt;TOM CLANCY - PATRIOT GAMES, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/book_03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/book_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;John Wick skin from Fortnite.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;thank u tom clancy, very cool&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Patriot Games&amp;rdquo; is something I had a copy of when I was a kid (for reasons I will never understand) but &amp;ldquo;The Hunt For Red October&amp;rdquo; is one I never sat down and read, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099810/&#34;&gt;despite its film adaptation being hands-down my third favorite movie of all time.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This re-read&amp;ndash;especially now that I&amp;rsquo;m a bit older and have had more than my share of Troubles with over-degreed and well-pedigreed fucks over the past few years&amp;ndash;hits a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of why Patriot Games hit home so much for me as a kid is because of one line that always stuck with me. There&amp;rsquo;s a scene early on in the book where Jack Ryan&amp;ndash;at this point in the timeline just a lowly ex-Marine who teaches history at Quantico and occasionally does some work for &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/q6TNe4FlirA?t=519&#34;&gt;Relno The Story-keeper&amp;rsquo;s favorite recurring villain&lt;/a&gt; that he Just Can&amp;rsquo;t Talk About&amp;ndash;finds himself a fish out of water at a dinner with the Royal Family. Sporting a busted arm and an overwhelming sense of anxiety and dread, he&amp;rsquo;s put at ease by the Queen herself stating gently, &amp;ldquo;Jack, the reason everyone here is fond of you is because of who and what you are. Try and keep that in mind.&amp;rdquo; Keeping that line in mind, especially as someone with my own battles with social anxiety, has carried me through quite a few shitty imposter-syndrome-laden dinners of my own, and for the most part Patriot Games keeps that anxiety at the core of the book. Jack being way out of his depth is a plot point that humanizes the man, and in the film adaptation of &amp;ldquo;The Hunt For Red October&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s the crux of his character. And it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0011/book_04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0011/book_04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;John Wick skin from Fortnite.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;If you think I&#39;m fucking with you about it getting infinitely dumber as the series goes on, I&#39;d like to point out that this is the canonical reason Jack Ryan eventually becomes president at the end of &#34;Debt Of Honor&#34;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issue with the novel is that &lt;em&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s not that&lt;/em&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s a man whose background has a lot of weird amounts of prestige added to it, and the entire book is filled with folks who seem to belong to the Patting Themselves On The Back Club, Skull And Bones Chapter. Literally the only relatable character in the book is Captain Marko Ramius himself. Everyone else seems to have stumbled their way upwards through either generational wealth, generational status, Good Old Fashioned American Exceptionalism&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; that just seems to be written in the same way that the people that glorify fail-upwards-morons like Daddy Elon seem to write their characters, or a little of Columns A, B, and C. This is a problem that would persist in every subsequent Clancy novel from there on out&amp;ndash;albeit to much more enjoyable Action Movie Bullshit levels&amp;ndash;and it is a problem in Patriot Games as well. Hell, there&amp;rsquo;s a scene in Patriot Games where Clancy insists upon showing you that Jack Ryan has a superhuman sense for making Good Stock Trades, which is undermined juuust a little bit if you overlook the fact that what he&amp;rsquo;s doing is acting on privileged information he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have and could, if he were any less rich, fall under the lines of &amp;ldquo;prosecutable insider trading&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;a point which Clancy touches on, then utterly ignores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole thing, annoyingly enough, feels tone deaf now that I&amp;rsquo;m not an impressionable youngster and will never be a Harvard grad. Still recommend the movie tho, and Patriot Games still has a slammingly good climax and some fantastic writing to it&amp;ndash;assuming you can overlook the whole America Gud Third Wurld Not Gud parts, that is. Older I get, the more I have trouble doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-smoking&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN SMOKING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re seeing a pattern in the headings in this section here, that&amp;rsquo;s because there is one. Pipes And Cigars had a blowout sale on Peterson tins, and seeing as I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be out of Denver by now I went ahead and stocked up so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pick up more tobacco once we get into the new place if I ran out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, most of these aren&amp;rsquo;t to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;petersons-de-luxe-navy-rolls&#34;&gt;PETERSON&amp;rsquo;S DE LUXE NAVY ROLLS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time trying a coin cut, and at first I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what to make of it. I smoked through the entire tin in six days, though, so clearly I enjoyed it. Then again, I tend to enjoy VaPer blends, so there is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room note is a bit strong, even by my standards, but it does smell pairs well with fresh-brewed coffee. And seeing as I nearly always have a pot going, that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;peterson-early-morning-pipepeterson-nightcap&#34;&gt;PETERSON EARLY MORNING PIPE/PETERSON NIGHTCAP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly iconic duo that I suppose I expected more from. To be honest, Early Morning is a bit more to my liking than Nightcap was, but then again that would check out anyways, seeing as I tend to enjoy Virginias over Latakias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;peterson-irish-flake&#34;&gt;PETERSON IRISH FLAKE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jotted this one down when I originally penned the table-of-contents for this column, but despite making a point to do so at the time, I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember smoking this one. Usually, the Irish and I tend to see eye-to-eye on a good many things&amp;ndash;we share the same sentiments on whisky, beer, tea, and (I would imagine) pipe tobacco. So you would assume I&amp;rsquo;d remember smoking this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t. I have to imagine it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;, or I&amp;rsquo;d have at least remembered &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. But I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if it was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welp. Not much of a review, but still. If I ever pick up another tin of this, I&amp;rsquo;ll let y&amp;rsquo;all know what&amp;rsquo;s up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;assuming I remember to, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;petersons-perfect-plug-3ps&#34;&gt;PETERSON&amp;rsquo;S PERFECT PLUG (3P&amp;rsquo;S)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just finished smoking a pipeful of this now as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, actually. I will say that it&amp;rsquo;s much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more compact than any other plug tobacco I&amp;rsquo;ve smoked&amp;ndash;you&amp;rsquo;re going to need a knife for this one. With that stated, I like it. It burns well, has a heady yet tolerable hit (I do love my heavies) and sports a lovely, woody room note. As long as you have a decently sharp blade on hand&amp;ndash;my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opinel-usa.com/collections/opinel-pocket-knives&#34;&gt;Opinel carbon steel&lt;/a&gt; works lovely&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s well worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S NEXT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be doing a LOT of reading over the next few months, although it&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of reading I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing for pleasure. &amp;ldquo;Snakes&amp;rdquo; is proving to be far more of an undertaking than I&amp;rsquo;d imagine, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a shelf stacked full of case law, queer history, and current events articles for me to slog through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, however, also expect to have a few more movies and teevee shows to gripe about, seeing as I just loaded my Android device back up with more big dumb action movies. So look forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all I got for now. I&amp;rsquo;m jumping right from penning this to quickly hammering out this month&amp;rsquo;s Jazz Program and Talkie Time schedule, so you should be able to peep that right after you peep this as they&amp;rsquo;ll probably find themselves out on the same day. I&amp;rsquo;ve also got a new column that I hope you folks will enjoy hitting this site soon, so stay tuned for that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, thanks as always for reading. You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;SARAH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of being in the gym five out of seven days of the week to manage my ADHD is that I have a weird amount of time to camp on the treadmill and watch movies, as well as listen to new stuff either for The Jazz Program or for myself. See also the section on &amp;ldquo;Workout Jamz&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t know how, but we&amp;rsquo;ve had snow in April here. This place sucks. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to use the men&amp;rsquo;s locker room&amp;ndash;being naturally bald kind of prevents me from even remotely passing enough to change in the women&amp;rsquo;s, and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a gender neutral option. Even if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case, this is just kind of reality for most trans/gay folk, unfortunately. A lot of the survival skills I learned when I was openly gay in the Missourian backwoods still have to be applied over a decade later in a relatively blue city. Some things never change, unfortunately. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When I used to drive semis, &amp;lsquo;Next Exit&amp;rsquo; (track one on &amp;ldquo;Antics&amp;rdquo;) was my alarm clock, and I&amp;rsquo;d spend my first few hours listening through their discography (with TOTBL following Antics, because how are you gonna skip TOTBL) while getting the engine warmed up and my brain woken up. I&amp;rsquo;ll also occasionally put on listen to Cake&amp;rsquo;s discography in chronological order for the same reasons, especially if I&amp;rsquo;m doing some writing instead of drawing that day. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find most of my &amp;ldquo;jesus fuck this is fantastic I gotta find this album&amp;rdquo; tracks on either &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kuvo.org/&#34;&gt;KUVO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kdhx.org/&#34;&gt;KDHX&lt;/a&gt;, and (of course) &lt;a href=&#34;https:/soma.fm&#34;&gt;Soma.fm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering &amp;ldquo;is the big bad something gender/queerness related?&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m not watchin&amp;rsquo; the fuckin&amp;rsquo; thing, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751129/&#34;&gt;according to IMDB&lt;/a&gt;, probably, yeah. Hell, Googling the name of the episode gives the description &amp;ldquo;A series of sexually-oriented murders that are identical, except that the killer appears to be both male and female, draws Scully and Mulder to an Amish-type community of people who may be alien in origin&amp;rdquo;, which is somehow &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; of a descriptor than IMDB gave. I&amp;rsquo;m good, bruh. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re curious as to which of the listed movie selections were me starting shit with her and which was Autumn starting shit with me&amp;hellip;Punisher Warzone was her pick, and The Rock was mine. Although, in fairness (as I kinda go into in the section about it) I was told The Rock would at least be interesting. So yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s my bad. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;rsquo;s probably a bit inside-baseball for the cis sections of my audience, but the scene where &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/cCbgjrb75fg?t=209&#34;&gt;Loony Bin Jim shatters every single mirror so that Jigsaw never has to look at his reflection again&lt;/a&gt; borderline &lt;em&gt;screams&lt;/em&gt; T4T romance to me in how it shows one person caring for another by doing their best to mitigate dysphoria through any means necessary, including by physically destroying mirrors with their own body. Although the tiiiny little detail where they&amp;rsquo;re, you know, &lt;em&gt;blood relation brothers&lt;/em&gt; makes that a bit weird&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:10&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112401/&#34;&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, second is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/&#34;&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/a&gt;. In the current runnings, at least. As with everything else, this list is subject to change. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:11&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s for this reason that Alec Baldwin will always be The Man to play Jack Ryan as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. His portrayal in The Hunt For Red October hits exactly the parts of Ryan&amp;rsquo;s character that nail him down as a relatable protagonist before the later books spiral out of control and have him stumbling upwards to the Presidency through some capital-letter Utter Bullshit Writing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jackryan.fandom.com/wiki/Debt_of_Honor&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Debt of Honor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. See also the attached screenshot above if you think I&amp;rsquo;m fuckin&amp;rsquo; with you. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#010: : Much Ado About Cassette Tapes: May 2023 Radio Programming Calendar</title>
      <link>/post/0010/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to tune in, &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;head on over to datafruits.fm/chat&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&amp;rsquo;re broadcasting this week&amp;hellip;well, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a bit of an interlude&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-i-knew-what-i-was-doing-it-wouldnt-be-called-research----sourcing-the-history-of-old-time-radio&#34;&gt;IF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, IT WOULDN&amp;rsquo;T BE CALLED RESEARCH &amp;ndash; SOURCING THE HISTORY OF OLD TIME RADIO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/01.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Some of the many physical tapes in my collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we talked about my history with collecting old-time radio, the Dead, and other fun things on cassettes, as well as a bit of my history with manipulating cassettes in my work as a musician and DJ. Collecting these little guys is fun and all, but when it comes to researching them for these write-ups and for the show, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more than just spinning .mp3s that goes into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the old time radio hobby was kind of open season. Much like found footage groups, folks would trade cassettes at swap meets, often with very little in the way of labeling, consistency in naming conventions, or much else. The transition to .mp3s and filesharing in the late &amp;rsquo;90s, and early &amp;rsquo;00s didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly help much. It was pretty common to find shows with woefully incorrect metadata, or literally no metadata at all. Thankfully, these days we have a lot of groups that have gone out of their way to research, catalogue, and document as much as possible about these pieces of radio history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://audionoir.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Audio Noir&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Another fantastic station worth tuning into, Audio Noir plays nothing but the great detectives 24/7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://otrr.org&#34;&gt;The OTRR&lt;/a&gt; is often my first port of call when doing research on a new program to play on the air. Between their encylcopedic main website &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Old+Time+Radio+Researchers+Group%22&#34;&gt;and their archive work on archive.org&lt;/a&gt;, if a radio show exists these folks probably have it in their registry. They even have a program on offer called &lt;a href=&#34;https://otrr.org/?c=otter&#34;&gt;OTTER&lt;/a&gt;, which fixes metadata and helps track down missing info in case you find a show file that&amp;rsquo;s incomplete, and the &lt;a href=&#34;ttps://www.otrr.org/OTRRPedia/pedia.html&#34;&gt;OTTRPedia&lt;/a&gt; is another great resource for finding that kind of info manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tracking down exact show air dates, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com&#34;&gt;Old Time Radio Downloads&lt;/a&gt; usually has pretty close to what I&amp;rsquo;d be looking for. I try and list the exact date of air for each show when I can, but sometimes the dates conflict. Ninety nine percent of the time, OTRD has the exact date of air I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. OTTRPedia also often has that info, but I like the way OTRD has it displayed; a simple CTRL+F and a quick type of the episode name gets me the info I need, quick as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to keep you locked on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; during my show hours, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other Internet radio stations&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I use to discover new-to-me shows to share with all of you. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oldtime.radio/&#34;&gt;Oldtime.radio&lt;/a&gt; is a great web player with different &amp;ldquo;stations&amp;rdquo; that are sorted by genre, &lt;a href=&#34;http://audionoir.com/&#34;&gt;Audio Noir&lt;/a&gt; is a former pirate radio station (and current Internet radio station) out of Chicago that focuses on the best of noir radio plays, and if you want a break from the radio plays and want some call-in cranks and spoops, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u7radio.org/&#34;&gt;U7&lt;/a&gt; plays the best of Art Bell twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of radio&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-2023-talkie-time--jazz-program-schedule&#34;&gt;MAY 2023 TALKIE TIME / JAZZ PROGRAM SCHEDULE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-2-2023&#34;&gt;May 2, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--lives-of-harry-lime---works-of-art--clay-pidgeon&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Lives Of Harry Lime - Works Of Art / Clay Pidgeon&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; No, not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Harry Lyme. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/characters/nm0000582&#34;&gt;Different movie.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Third Man&amp;rsquo;, released in 1949, directed by Carol Reed, and starring Joseph Cotten in the lead role of Holly Martins and the great Orson Welles himself as Harry Lime, is an undisputed classic of film noir. Hell, the British Film Institute once declared it the greatest British film of all time. At the risk of spoiling an over seventy year old movie, the film follows Martins attempting to find out who killed his friend Lime, only to find out that Lime faked his own death. Lime eventually finds himself actually killed by Martins, and that&amp;rsquo;s where the story ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film isn&amp;rsquo;t where the story of Harry Lime &lt;em&gt;begins&lt;/em&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring Welles reprising his role from the 1949 cult movie, &amp;lsquo;Lives Of Harry Lime&amp;rsquo; forms a series of prequels of sorts, telling the many tales of Lime&amp;rsquo;s work (and many lives) as a con artist. As Welles himself puts it, &amp;ldquo;Harry Lime had many lives&amp;hellip; and I can recount all of them. How do I know? Very simple. Because my name is Harry Lime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to &amp;ldquo;Works Of Art&amp;rdquo;, originally aired on September 28, 1951, and &amp;ldquo;Clay Pidgeon&amp;rdquo;, which aired on August 17, 1951.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-presents-_first-of-the-month-listener-request-night_--chick-corea-for-the-boss-man&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program Presents &lt;em&gt;First Of The Month: Listener Request Night&lt;/em&gt; : Chick Corea for The Boss Man&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Listener Request night again, and we&amp;rsquo;ve got a top-priority request here. Datafruits&amp;rsquo; own big cheese, MC Firedrill&amp;ndash;or &amp;ldquo;Ton&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; as I often refer to him&amp;ndash; wants to hear some Chick Corea. And who am I to refuse the Big Cheese?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we&amp;rsquo;ll be playing three records from Chick Corea&amp;rsquo;s Elektric Band, namely 1986&amp;rsquo;s self-titled, 1987&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Light Years&amp;rsquo; and 1991&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Beneath The Mask.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-9-2023&#34;&gt;May 9, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &#34;shut up and bring daddy the FUCKIN REMOTE or im GOIN OUT FOR CIGARETTES&#34; -- Randy Stone, probably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--night-beat---number-13--i-wish-you-were-dead&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Night Beat - Number 13 / I Wish You Were Dead&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many legends of radio and TV with some notable sponsors. Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; radio theatre troupe was notably sponsored by Campbell Soup. Jim Henson got his start &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhIizQQol0&#34;&gt;blowing up proto-Muppets in the name of Wilkin&amp;rsquo;s Coffee.&lt;/a&gt; But very few can say that they were sponsored by your alcoholic stepdad&amp;rsquo;s breakfast of choice&amp;ndash;namely, the winning combination of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Wheaties.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night Beat has that honor. Starring Frank Lovejoy himself as reporter Randy Stone, each episode has Stone on the titular night beat for the Chicago Star, and each episode ends with him screaming for the copy boy to take his story in to the editor&amp;rsquo;s office because he was just too lazy to do it himself, just like your alcoholic stepdad used to do about the TV remote. Sponsored by the breakfast of champions, indeed. We&amp;rsquo;ll be hearing &amp;lsquo;Number 13&amp;rsquo;, which originally aired on March 6, 1950, as well as &amp;lsquo;I Wish You Were Dead&amp;rsquo;, which originally aired on May 22, 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-smoke-if-ya-got-em---joe-hendersons-relaxin-at-camarillo-1979-antonio-carlos-jobims-stoneflower-1970-and-jeremy-manasias-witchery-2007&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: Smoke If Ya Got &amp;lsquo;Em - Joe Henderson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Relaxin&amp;rsquo; at Camarillo&amp;rsquo; (1979), Antonio Carlos Jobim&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Stoneflower&amp;rsquo; (1970), and Jeremy Manasia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Witchery&amp;rsquo; (2007)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Witchery cover art&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; I genuinely don&#39;t know why, but I can&#39;t look at this cover art and &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; hear a reggae cover of &#39;Ocean Man&#39;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, we gotta have at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; dumbass theme night on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of &amp;ldquo;records with dudes smoking on the cover&amp;rdquo; honestly comes directly from my recent listens of Jeremy Manasia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Witchery&amp;rdquo;, a record I put on because the cover amused the hell out of me. The idea of a relatively energetic piano jazz record with a cover art featuring the lead pianist ripping a hit off a blunt with &amp;lsquo;Murica sunglasses and a giant doofy grin on his face is just a fantastic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then occurred to me that there&amp;rsquo;s an absurd amount of jazz records that just have &amp;ldquo;band leader hitting a cigar/cigarette/blunt&amp;rdquo; for cover art. So, I put together a list. You find recurring themes in the strangest places, man. We&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to Joe Henderson&amp;rsquo;s seminal &amp;lsquo;Relaxin&amp;rsquo; At Camarillo&amp;rsquo;, Jobim&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece of bossa nova &amp;lsquo;Stone Flower&amp;rsquo;, and the aforementioned New York jazz scene staple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Witchery&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-16-2023&#34;&gt;May 16, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--dick-lawrence-review---lost-pilot-of-a-lost-age&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Dick Lawrence Review - Lost Pilot Of A Lost Age&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/05.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Witchery cover art&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; RIP to yet another fantastic classical music station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast from the legendary (and now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bruceduffie.com/awnibwiki.html&#34;&gt;overtaken by a soft rock station and apparently wiped from the face of Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) classical station WNIB in Chicago in the &amp;rsquo;80s and &amp;rsquo;90s, The Dick Lawrence Review is an interesting case in the history of narrative radio. A writer &amp;amp; vintage music historian who got his start in the early 1970s at WXFM with a &amp;ldquo;Roaring 20s&amp;rdquo; show, Dick&amp;rsquo;s radio programs combined vintage music, pulp magazine stories, and what he called &amp;ldquo;audio archeology, a restoration of antiq sounds&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to find many recordings of his show (or even a photo of the man), and the ones I could track down have very little in terms of metadata and broadcast dates, but the ones I have found are fantastic. We&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to &amp;ldquo;Lost Pilot Of A Lost Age&amp;rdquo; tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-ben-webster---see-you-at-the-fair-1964--ben-webster-plays-duke-ellington-1989--soulville-1957&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: Ben Webster - See You At The Fair (1964) / Ben Webster Plays Duke Ellington (1989) / Soulville (1957)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love me some Ben Webster. Old-time fans of the show know that, before we went to an &amp;ldquo;artist spotlight&amp;rdquo;-type format, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkiFKnIio7I&#34;&gt;title track from his record &amp;ldquo;Soulville&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was our unofficial theme song. Slow, jazzy, and the perfect theme to &amp;ldquo;light up a smoke, light a cigar, and light your local police precinct on fire&amp;rdquo; (as the old opening to the show used to go), Ben and the gang know how to set a mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be setting plenty of moods this evening, with 1964&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;See You At The Fair&amp;rdquo;, 1989&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Ben Webster Plays Duke Ellington&amp;rsquo;, and the aforementioned &amp;lsquo;Soulville&amp;rsquo;, released in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-23-2023&#34;&gt;May 23, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time-fear-on-four---green-and-pleasant--survival&#34;&gt;Talkie Time: Fear On Four - Green And Pleasant / Survival&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aired originally between 1988 and 1997 on BBC4, &amp;ldquo;Fear On Four&amp;rdquo; features host Edward de Souza as &amp;ldquo;The Man In Black&amp;rdquo; in a fantastic horror anthology series. If there was ever a BBC Radio production that saw the sound staff earning their paycheck, this is it. The foley is impeccable, and with stories by authors like Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight we&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to &amp;lsquo;Green And Pleasant&amp;rsquo;, written by Bert Coules and originally airing on January 3, 1991, and &amp;lsquo;Survival&amp;rsquo;, adapted from a story by John Wyndham and originally airing on March 19, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; It may shock you to hear, but this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a photograph of a German organist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pop jazz scene in the 60s and 70s was a weird one, as exemplified by last month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://truckstop.coffee/post/0006/#the-jazz-program-tom-jones-pretends-to-be-an-american-for-two-hours-to-varied-but-amusing-results-tom-1970-darlin1981the-body-and-soul-of-tom-jones-1973&#34;&gt;Tom Jones Pretends To Be An American For Two Hours, To Varied But Amusing Results&lt;/a&gt;. Carrying on with that theme, we have legendary German jazz organist and composer Ingfried Hoffman, who&amp;hellip;well, for some reason, donned the visage of a black-as-fuck soul band from the deep South for two entire records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest, I tried as hard as I could to figure out a way to frame this episode without a &amp;ldquo;yeah no, this is not okay&amp;rdquo;-type disclaimer. Unfortunately for me, we&amp;rsquo;re pulling pseudonymous European jazz records from the time period which had both the golden age of blaxsploitation cinema and a European jazz scene that saw a lot of composers for television getting into producing their own records and finding out real quick that putting a random well-to-do TV-sound-booth white guy in a suit on the cover was not going to move discs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0010/07.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0010/07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Soul Cowboy cover art&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The actual &#34;Memphis Black&#34;. No, I don&#39;t know what to do with that information either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingfried spent a lot of his earlier career played with Rolf Kühn and many others during this time period &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so there is a distinct possibility this was meant as an explicit tribute to the Memphis scene that just so happened to wear the face of American blaxploitation cinema because that&amp;rsquo;s the inspiration he was pulling from. Or, more likely, they just wanted to move records, and figured putting a young black chick on the cover would be more effective than an old German dude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of intent, there&amp;rsquo;s an absurd amount of musical blackface from this period in music history, and there&amp;rsquo;s no getting around that. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna ignore this time period on a show dedicated to deep dives in and around jazz, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not just slap a &amp;ldquo;this music was a product of its time&amp;rdquo; label on this episode and play the records without pointing this all out, or ignore the problematic elements of this time period entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, tonight&amp;rsquo;s show features two of his records under the pseudonym of &amp;ldquo;Memphis Black&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Memphis Soul Band&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;depending on where you were in the world when buying this record, as the releases differ in the US and EU releases&amp;ndash;as well as his eponymous release &amp;ldquo;From Twen With Love&amp;rdquo;. Disclaimer aside, these three releases are some of the finest examples of chill-out organ work from this time period, and are fairly essential and rare grooves from a time period that would eventually lay the foundation for electronic genres like trip-hop, downtempo, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re continuing our end-of-the-month listenthrough of &amp;ldquo;Cloak And Dagger&amp;rdquo;, the radio drama adaptation of Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain&amp;rsquo;s 1946 book &amp;ldquo;Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS&amp;rdquo;, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I&amp;rsquo;ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our third night in our listen-through of the full series, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month&amp;rsquo;s edition&amp;ndash;namely, &amp;lsquo;The Kachin Story&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Direct Lines To Bombers&amp;rsquo;, which aired on June 18, 1950 and June 25, 1950 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like we say every month &amp;ndash; those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We&amp;rsquo;ll be taking our first steps into the original first volume of the pirate site master compilation, with discs 1-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the show lineup for this month! I&amp;rsquo;ll be back in a few days with a few other posts&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to write about that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to put up here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a bunch of life stuff, including getting ready to finally leave Colorado and head off to greener pastures. I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re talking more about talkies than jazz here, but if you&amp;rsquo;d like other Internet radio stations to tune into that have similar jazzy sounds to my own, I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&amp;rsquo;t include &lt;a href=&#34;https://somafm.com/secretagent/&#34;&gt;Illinois Street Lounge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://somafm.com/secretagent/&#34;&gt;Secret Agent&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://soma.fm&#34;&gt;soma.fm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a strange thing for me to fixate on, I want to point out that this strange sponsorship pairing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Beat_(radio_program)&#34;&gt;is literally in the first three lines of the Wikipedia article.&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna guess that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who finds that combo unintentionally hilarious. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To underscore the point of &amp;ldquo;yeah no, literally half the records from this time period and in this genre were just Not Okay by today&amp;rsquo;s standards&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that Ingfried&amp;rsquo;s first LP credit with Rolf Kühn&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/486693-Rolf-K%C3%BChn-feat-Klaus-Doldinger-Rolf-K%C3%BChn-Feat-Klaus-Doldinger&#34;&gt;namely, &amp;lsquo;Rolf Kuhn feat. Klaus Doldinger&amp;rsquo;, released in 1962&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;was only three years after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/206156-Martin-Denny-Afro-Desia&#34;&gt;Martin Denny&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Afro-Desia&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, another record (and composer) who we&amp;rsquo;ll eventually get to on another episode with its own disclaimer. Popular jazz in the &amp;rsquo;50s, &amp;rsquo;60s and early &amp;rsquo;70s was just kinda appropriational at best and outright &amp;lsquo;of its time&amp;rsquo; type racist at worst. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/post/0009/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0009/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly hesitated to write about this topic; it&amp;rsquo;s a personal one that&amp;rsquo;s heavy even by my standards, and on top of that it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy thing to talk about. With that stated, it has kind of colored my output (when it hasn&amp;rsquo;t outright prevented me from creating work at all) for the past few years, and to be quite frank I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up covering it (or aspects of it) in one of my upcoming books anyways. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s also offset by the fact that, despite the overall depressing nature of this topic, I did make it out the other end, and even if that weren&amp;rsquo;t the case I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t really know where else I could even begin to write about it if not here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;floatleft&#34; src=&#34;/heavysm.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair warning: the following segment is incredibly heavy, and directly discusses eating disorders, alcoholism, severe dysphoria, and suicide. I usually try to keep this particular blog a bit lighter and goofier than the heavy subjects I usually touch on in my books, but I wanted to talk about this and get it out of my system. However, I&amp;rsquo;m putting a disclaimer here so you have the opportunity to skip this piece if you&amp;rsquo;d like. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t in a good place or are affected by these types of heavier topics, I would skip this post entirely, and go read one of my happier or goofier ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past three years have seen me battling alcoholism and my eating disorder harder than I honestly have ever have had to. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an alcoholic of either the on- or off-the-wagon variety for most of my adult life, and the past few years have been very much a time where I&amp;rsquo;ve been either chasing after the wagon screaming at the driver to slow down, barely clinging onto the side for dear life, or face-down in the gutter on the side of the road, so drunk that I forgot there was a wagon at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty open throughout my career and in my work about my battles with depression and mental illness&amp;ndash;hell, I literally released an album called &amp;ldquo;Suicidal&amp;rdquo; during my stay here in Colorado&amp;ndash;but one thing I don&amp;rsquo;t talk as much about is how gender dysphoria factors into both my depression and my alcoholism. A large part of why I drink is rooted, ironically enough, in survival. I drink so I can forget things that have happened, drink so I can forget that some things never will happen, drink so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have reasons to live in times where I don&amp;rsquo;t have things around me to keep me distracted and keep me alive. Drinking was how I got through the years when I knew I was trans but wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a safe enough place to risk coming out. Drinking was how I got through some of the times when my dysphoria got so bad that I had to cover all of the mirrors in the house just to avoid looking at my reflection so I didn&amp;rsquo;t break down. And drinking is how I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten through most of my time in Colorado without dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have spent most of my adult life battling something I usually don&amp;rsquo;t talk about. Those who have followed me through the years have probably noticed that, every three or four years or so, my weight has fluctuated to degrees that a body isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to in that short of an amount of time. Part of this is survival as well, albeit of a very different kind. There have been multiple times in my life where I have had to work multiple odd jobs, sleeping very little and eating enough to keep myself going through twenty-plus hour stretches. The beginning of the pandemic saw that happen repeatedly. By the time I released the aforementioned Ophelia Drowning record &amp;ldquo;Suicidal&amp;rdquo;, I had had to switch my schedule four times in less than two months in order to get enough hours at the odd jobs I was working to pay my rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of that was because&amp;hellip;well, I have an eating disorder. Since I was a teenager, I have alternated between periods where I take militantly good care of myself&amp;ndash;eating a proper protein-heavy fitness diet, going to the gym, shedding pounds, and doing everything I can to take care of my body&amp;ndash;and periods of violent depression, binge eating, over-exerting myself in the gym to grow my muscles to threatening proportions, and bulimic episodes when it finally hits me that growing my muscles in order to appear threatening so people don&amp;rsquo;t fuck with me are literally the worst thing for my dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstances of how I ended up in Colorado are a topic for another article (or book) entirely, but suffice it to say that the events in which I ended up here and the other happenings of the two years afterwards were bad enough to plunge me into one of the latter periods. When I arrived in Colorado in the fall of 2019, I was a fairly slim 170. Three years later, in the early months of 2022, I weighed at around 215. I was tossing on 60lbs of weighted equipment and slamming my strongfat body shape through hours worth of weighted cardio, and then getting home and pounding multiple glasses of Canadian Club, cans of Olde English, or whatever other cheap whisky or malt liquor I could afford until I threw up. I was inordinately dysphoric, almost cripplingly agoraphobic, and hated myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the spring of 2022, I somehow managed to get a consultation appointment for FFS. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is, facial feminization surgery, or FFS, is a surgical procedure which re-arranges certain bones in the face in order to &amp;ldquo;feminize&amp;rdquo; it. Square stonejaws (like mine) can be softened, rough edges can be softened, Adam&amp;rsquo;s apples sanded down. For someone like me, something like this would be considered medically necessary by most trans healthcare providers&amp;ndash;when I said last paragraph that I often find myself in a position where I have to cover all the mirrors so I don&amp;rsquo;t see my own reflection and have a breakdown, I&amp;rsquo;m not joking. It&amp;rsquo;s also something that, in most places that I&amp;rsquo;ve lived, has been perpetually off the table. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my transition (and adult life in general) in and out of homelessness, and there have been entire years where I&amp;rsquo;ve not even had access to hormone therapy, having to crash in a van or a car while the testosterone in my body slowly takes back over and rots me from the inside. Something like FFS was something I honestly thought I&amp;rsquo;d never have access to, and it also, according to the doctor I was somehow able to see thanks to Colorado&amp;rsquo;s policies of covering transgender care, would supposedly be covered by Colorado Medicaid. It was something that probably would have permanently changed my life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Would&lt;/em&gt; have, had things not gone downhill. Unfortunately, the slope started the minute the surgeon walked in the room for the initial consult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;ve not had consistent access to adequate medical care for most of my life, and as a direct result I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I am not exactly acquainted with the ins and outs of decorum and politesse that surgeons are advised to abide by. I am, however, fairly certain that, if you are intending to drag a random med student into the consultation room as a &amp;ldquo;teaching moment&amp;rdquo; after the nurses take down initial information, you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to inform the patient and get their consent first &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; dragging the medical student in. I&amp;rsquo;m also fairly certain that repeatedly making remarks about the &amp;ldquo;residual fat&amp;rdquo; in the patient&amp;rsquo;s face in front of said medical student, as well as repeatedly interrupting the patient, misgendering them, and referring to parts of their facial structure as &amp;ldquo;masculine&amp;rdquo; as you take a pair of measuring calipers to their face in front of a random onlooker the patient did not want there, is also not exactly considered the height of bedside manner. Hell, if your patient is in your office for &lt;em&gt;a fuckin&amp;rsquo; gender dysphoria diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;, it might not be what one would consider appropriate to tell them to take their wig off in front of the aforementioned nurses who didn&amp;rsquo;t bother leaving the room, a random medical student who shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been in the room to begin with, and God himself, and then loudly commentate to said audience the &amp;ldquo;very masculine&amp;rdquo; measurements and hair patterns of the back of the patient&amp;rsquo;s exposed skull which was ravaged by male pattern baldness from an abnormally young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it in a type of phrasing that belies my lack of an Ivy League education and upper-class manners: were it not for the fact that I had the ability to cry beaten out of me as a child over a decade and some change prior, I probably would have broken down in the exam room. Hell, a decade and some change ago, a much angrier me would have attempted to personally re-arrange his jaw. And while the current, older version me is very proud of the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made with my anger since taking an oath of nonviolence all those years ago, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would have thought ill of twenty-year old me for busting him one in the chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I went home, I drank, and I ate too much. I woke up the next day, and I drank again. And at some point in the next few months of drinking, I probably cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I struggled between drinking myself into oblivion and relapsing into a new kind of eating disorder. The doc told me I was manly and fat, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be fat or manly, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t eat. If I did eat, I compulsively counted calories, including the calories I drank. The doc told me that there would be a pre-checkup a month before my surgery, and if they found nicotine in my blood they would cancel the surgery, so I stopped smoking, leaving me without the closest thing to ADHD medicine I had access to, and as a result I became irritable, started missing deadlines, and stopped being able to focus on my work. To compensate, I went to the gym. I spent more and more time in the gym when I bothered to leave the house, which was rarely if ever if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to the liquor store, just to keep my ADHD under control; and when that failed to reign in my ADHD, I drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent more and more time drunk. I drank alone because I had no one to talk to, and I had no friends to talk to so I drank. I had struggled with maintaining professional networks pretty heavily over the past two years, but as I struggled more I had more and more breakdowns, and I distanced myself from my peers and they distanced themselves from me. The distance made me lonely, so I drank to forget I was lonely and I drank alone. I had reached out multiple times in the previous two years to try and talk to folks around me, try and get some help, someone to listen to, but eventually I suppose I grew tiresome to talk to and the folks I went to for help stopped responding, so I drank to forget that help wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming. I tried multiple times to go to local gay bars, trying my damnest to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t drinking alone if I was going to drink myself into oblivion, but try as I might no one found me worth talking to and I ended up drinking alone anyways. There were multiple nights where I would pound whisky on an empty stomach because I refused to eat. There were multiple nights where Autumn had to leave a bucket next to the floor that I had passed out on so I didn&amp;rsquo;t projectile vomit all over the floor again in my sleep. There was at least one night where I wandered through Colfax, headphones on, blasting Sinatra&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Where Are You&amp;rdquo;, wasted out of my mind, stumbling into random bars trying to find someone&amp;ndash;anyone&amp;ndash;to talk to so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be alone, and eventually gave up and wandered into the road in the hopes that a car would hit me and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to do this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I desperately tried to get the docs to change my surgeon. I did everything short of lodging a formal complaint, mainly because if I had a dollar for every time a member of the office responded to my request for literally any other surgeon by going on a rant at me about how the surgeon in question &amp;ldquo;was a very intelligent and well-respected member of the medical community&amp;rdquo; and refused to tell me how to actually file a complaint, I&amp;rsquo;d have had enough for a pint of brandy and a twenty-ounce of Coke Zero to drown it in. You would think that it would not be a difficult matter to get a patient who is visibly uncomfortable with a specific doctor another doctor, but the closest I got was them moving the surgery date to nearly six months after its original date so that another surgeon could &amp;ldquo;be in the room with and supervise&amp;rdquo; the surgeon who I repeatedly stated I did not want anywhere near either knives or my face. Despite the fact that no one clearly was listening, however, I kept bitching. Usually, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that, if you bitch loud enough, &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; will listen and occasionally someone, and I&amp;rsquo;ll take the fact that I have a stone jaw will bother doing something about the issue at hand. And, eventually, I was proven right. Someone in the office &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; the Medicaid paperwork to get my surgery approved, and outright canceled my appointment three weeks before it was supposed to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have zero idea &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; in the office did this. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m honestly surprised I got it out of the lady who I even managed to get on the phone after two days of repeatedly dialing the office, and I get the feeling that the fact that it was mentioned at all was the type of slip that she was specifically instructed not to make. Retaliation in medical care is usually the kind of thing malpractice lawsuits get filed over, and to be quite frank I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you manage to &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; a patient&amp;rsquo;s Medicaid filing when your office directly worked with the patient to compile all of the paperwork necessary almost nine months prior unless someone in your office simply wishes to be rid of a meddlesome faggot. I have to assume that they were banking on the fact that a Medicaid patient doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the money for a lawyer, and that a poor kid with a history of mental disorders was too stupid to know either how the paperwork they claimed they had &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; worked or how to track down and file a complaint about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their bet was&amp;ndash;mostly&amp;ndash;a safe one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t file a complaint. I didn&amp;rsquo;t seek help. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much of anything. I knew they were full of shit, I knew it was retaliatory and more than likely illegal, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I knew is that I got a message on their online portal a week after they were supposed to have me come in for a pre-surgery checkup telling me that my surgery had been cancelled. All I knew that, after two days of calling the office, panicking and losing my mind, I finally got someone on the line who let it slip that no one had any idea where my paperwork&amp;ndash;of which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure had a copy on the online portal&amp;ndash;was, and that there would be no rescheduling. All I knew is that&amp;ndash;despite being told that I would finally have an opportunity to fix my body, that I would finally get help&amp;ndash;I was told that I was not getting any help, and there would be no surgeon, no rescheduling, no surgery, and no hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just drank. I drank, I starved myself, I covered the mirrors with blankets, and I cried. At some point, I deleted all of the photos of myself I could find from the Internet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see my face anymore. I knew it would never be fixed. I was never going to be worth fixing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of December, I finally put down the bottle. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what day I did, exactly, but I remember that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want Autumn to have to put up with me being drunk anymore, especially not for the holidays. I knew taking reality raw was not the smartest move, especially seeing as the Christmas season isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly easy for orphans like myself, but I was tired of drinking. I wanted my sister to at least have Christmas without all this shit. She kept me alive through all of this bullshit. It was the least I could give her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched the bottle since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been sober publicly until now, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to get sober so many times I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count. Taking the first step towards sobriety is something people care about the first time you do it. Fail at it enough times, start the counter over enough, and people stop expecting you to succeed, stop responding when you tell them about it hoping for encouragement. I suppose, in part, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve deserve to mention it until I hit some arbitrary number. Six months is long enough of a number, I reckon. Hopefully the count will keep going up, but this is at least long enough to talk about it in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I stopped working my arms and back and started just doing cardio. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to need my strength anymore, and so I just stopped working my arms and focused on being lithe and feminine, whether people try to beat the shit out of me for it or not. Autumn&amp;rsquo;s been helping me to realize I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a tank anymore to survive, and I would rather be lithe than a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I stopped counting calories, too. At last weigh-in, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit below 155. I don&amp;rsquo;t binge-eat anymore, thankfully, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a struggle to make sure I do in fact eat enough. Some days, I don&amp;rsquo;t, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn to be gentle with myself during those days. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of learning to be gentle with myself in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still struggle with severe dysphoria, and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly made much in the way of friends here in this town&amp;ndash;Autumn and Polyhymnia are still all I have&amp;ndash;but we&amp;rsquo;re leaving this state in a couple months and who knows, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to have access medical care there, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll make some friends, have a community, not be so fuckin&amp;rsquo; miserable. I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it another shot, at least. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved so many times and started again so many times that you&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d have given up on trying to find somewhere I belong, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just stubborn. If I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be stuck being alive, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna keep tryin&amp;rsquo; to make a life worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever have another opportunity to get FFS, or any other gender-affirming surgeries, whether I end up finding my way off of Medicaid or not. To be honest, at this point even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it ends up on the table I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll take it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through all that shit again, whether the doctors think I&amp;rsquo;m worth fixing or not. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my stone jaw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some in-progress photos of me working my way through Our Lady Maven Issue 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Inking panels from the comic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>#008: Studio News: March &amp; April 2023</title>
      <link>/post/0008/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0008/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey y’all! It’s your favorite dork, back at it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bit of a longer segment this month, so I&amp;rsquo;m breaking my &amp;ldquo;The Finer Things&amp;rdquo; into two segments; &amp;ldquo;Studio News&amp;rdquo;, where I talk about the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and what I&amp;rsquo;ve got in the pipeline, and &amp;ldquo;The Finer Things&amp;rdquo;, where I talk a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to, watching, reading, playing, and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also got a bit of a long, introspective topic to talk about, but that&amp;rsquo;s getting lopped into its own post as well; it&amp;rsquo;s heavy enough for one of my books, which means that I&amp;rsquo;d rather put it in its own little column instead of putting it in with the lighter things I usually talk about on this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more on that at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s the studio notes for the past couple months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-working-on&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN WORKING ON&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/01.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Signing copies of Our Lady Maven to send out to backers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-lady-maven&#34;&gt;OUR LADY MAVEN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Lady Maven Issue 1 is finally done, promo art and all, and it&amp;rsquo;s more or less all out the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve signed and sent back my portion of the signed copies we did for the crowdfunding campaign, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be packing up the original art the fine folks who picked them up for the crowdfunding campaign and writing letters to go with them soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot underscore how stoked I am to finally have this book out into the world, and both Em and I are very grateful for all of your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out the book yet, you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;/post/photoroll02&#34;&gt;this photo roll&lt;/a&gt; where I go into detail on the process of working through the issue itself, and you can also check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://globalcomix.com/c/our-lady-maven/chapters/en/1/&#34;&gt;on GlobalComix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourladymaven.com/shop/&#34;&gt;purchase a physical copy here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cigarettes-demo&#34;&gt;CIGARETTES DEMO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Mapping out the...er, map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been intermittently working on the &lt;a href=&#34;/post/0003/#what-ive-been-working-on&#34;&gt;adventure game you all saw last time&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a bit of a twist&amp;ndash;in order to flesh out the actual systems of the game in a slightly more low-stakes setting, Autumn ████████ and I have been crafting a tiny demo. Her and I have been collaborating for about a year and a half on developing a small TTRPG setting that we want to eventually expand upon, and I figured telling a story in that setting in a tiny demo of the ADV-style adventure game engine I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on developing in Renpy would be a fantastic way to make sure everything ticks just the way we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show on it currently&amp;ndash;and probably won&amp;rsquo;t for a bit, seeing as I&amp;rsquo;m about to start in on OLM Issue 2, as well as one other project I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about just yet and other comics that I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about later in this post. This will mostly be a little thing to hack on in the mornings when I&amp;rsquo;m still waking up and need something to get my mind rolling. Still, it is coming along decently nicely, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already got the map for the demo mostly plotted out, as you can see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of hacking on things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pinephones-porting-themes-and-other-open-source-fuckery&#34;&gt;PINEPHONES, PORTING THEMES, AND OTHER OPEN SOURCE FUCKERY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I own a Pinephone, and I love the little bastard. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the thing in place of a commonplace book, as a portable SSH terminal, as a ScummVM box that fits in my purse, and as a general fun-time hacky thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Rose Pine theme, ported to qt5. I&#39;m running &lt;a href=&#34;https://audacious-media-player.org/&#34;&gt;Audacious&lt;/a&gt; here for my music player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on making sure that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who gets to benefit from my tinkering (and occasional suffering). I had to manually port the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rosepinetheme.com/&#34;&gt;Rosé Pine theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to qt5ct (you can see it in the screenshot to your left there, running the QT version of Audacious), and ended up porting it to Xresources as well before being informed that they already had a theme going for it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rose-pine/xresources&#34;&gt;Thankfully the fine folks needed screenshots anyways, so I at least got to make one decent contribution.&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be sending them a qt5 theme as well, once I&amp;rsquo;ve finished up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I had a helluva time even getting qt5ct running on PostmarketOS (among other things, including bluetooth&amp;ndash;which involved multiple wipes-and-OS-reinstalls) and while she&amp;rsquo;s all set up now I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be putting together a little blog post so you all don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistakes I did. That&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a thing for next month, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got the ol&amp;rsquo; girl fairly close to a unixporn-worthy setup, though. She&amp;rsquo;s comin&amp;rsquo; along just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-comics-maybe&#34;&gt;NEW COMICS? MAYBE?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;floatleft&#34; src=&#34;/heavysm.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fair warning: the following segment talks about an in-progress book of mine that covers a particularly heavy topic&amp;ndash;namely, the ongoing mistreatment and attempted genocide of the transgender population by certain far-right subsects of the American government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know not everyone has the spoons to read about that right now, or even read about an in-progress book about it&amp;ndash;lord knows I barely have the spoons to write about it&amp;ndash;so if you&amp;rsquo;re not in a good place or just would prefer to skip ahead to the next section, go on ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as some of you have noticed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been angry-typing my way through a new script, &amp;ldquo;Snakes: A Brief And Personal History Of The Inner Workings Of Trans Genocide&amp;rdquo;, in response to my home state of Missouri officially criminalizing trans healthcare in the name of &amp;ldquo;consumer protections&amp;rdquo;; a hilariously dishonest one, seeing as half the billboards you see when entering our state advertise that you should buy your smokes here, because we have the lowest cigarette tax in the contiguous 48. Hell, we have multiple establishments in our fine state that are a combination smoke shop, gas station, and &lt;em&gt;fireworks emporium.&lt;/em&gt; I say this as a habitual cigar smoker and recovering alcoholic&amp;ndash;if Missouri gives a shit about public health, I&amp;rsquo;m the second coming of Anne Fuckin&amp;rsquo; Rice and I have a bridge to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with this obvious slam dunk of graphic journalism can be fairly clearly illustrated the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m probably the only one stupid enough to write it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest, I have zero expectation of this doing anything but getting me doxxed, harassed, and possibly shot, regardless of how much effort I put into it. I don&amp;rsquo;t see this getting picked up by any publisher or any magazine or periodical, a statement I say with some experience. I actually pitched this book last year to a couple graphic journalism outlets, and one of my friends even gave me a direct referral to her publisher. Not a single publisher took me up on it, and that was well over a year ago at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/04.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; An early draft of Snakes, with its original working title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with writing about trans issues is that most of the populace doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a shit about trans people dying, especially if the ones who die aren&amp;rsquo;t useful to the cis narrative, and there&amp;rsquo;s a certain segment of the population that would rather us straight up commit suicide than bother them with our existence at all.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even the folks that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about trans lives often will straight up not support work by trans folk that aren&amp;rsquo;t woefully capitulatory to the &amp;ldquo;generosity&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;acceptance&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;compassion&amp;rdquo; of the cis people around us, three things that a large section of the trans population rarely, if ever, get shown. In fact, unless you&amp;rsquo;re white, cis-passing, come from wealth or some kind of generational privilege, didn&amp;rsquo;t come out publicly until you&amp;rsquo;ve already done some kind of public-appeal work the cis folk liked, and don&amp;rsquo;t have an inordinately tragic backstory that involves you getting disowned, repeatedly sacked, and dragged through the mud and thrust into a state of depression and isolation that is nearly guaranteed to eventually kill you, you&amp;rsquo;re often doomed to not even be allowed near the microphones at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am exactly one of those things&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m also not writing about a fun part of the trans experience. I&amp;rsquo;m writing a series of arguments for the fact that the current persecution and violent treatment of trans folks in the United States is a direct&amp;ndash;and intentional&amp;ndash;mirror of the ten steps of genocide, as well as outlining my own personal history being raised in an abusive religious foster family, my experiences with a church (the one I was raised in, for the record) that directly funded the AIDS crisis and subsequent genocide of the gay community in the &amp;rsquo;80s and &amp;rsquo;90s, and the parallels between that event in American history and the one going on today in my own home state being pushed by ultra-Christian white supremacists who own copious amounts of guns and are more than happy to broadcast the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re willing to shoot minorities with them. This is not something anyone is going to pick up. This is not even remotely publishable. If anything, this is a death wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/04_1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/04_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Its current state, as of me typing out this blog. To say this has come together quickly is a bit of an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, that&amp;rsquo;s not remotely new to me. Hell, at the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m also working on BARREN, another book that I genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t think is going to get picked up by any publisher due to its violent content, fucked-up and complicated storyline, and its unflinchingly bleak ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of leaves me with exactly one option if I want to get these books out into the world, and that&amp;rsquo;s to publish them myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before&amp;ndash;Tabula Rosetta was my answer to the fact that no one wanted to publish my comics, and it ran for nine issues over nearly three years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to re-boot Tabula Rosetta; as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, it ran its course, and seeing as the first three chapters of the original draft of BARREN were published in the original run of TR, I think it&amp;rsquo;d be kind of weird having the tenth issue start up by telling a more refined version of the first chapter of a book that was already published in issue 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to go back to a regular release schedule. Tabula Rosetta&amp;rsquo;s bimonthly release schedule&amp;ndash;which was kept to even when I was living in a van and homeless on the east coast&amp;ndash;was more or less what stopped me from continuing it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk burning myself out by forcing myself into slamming through a regular release schedule, especially since I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with burnout for years anyways and haven&amp;rsquo;t released a full-length solo work in nearly four years at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this leaves us with is either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.  I&amp;rsquo;ll end up putting these comics online, on their own website, as I finish each chapter, or;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.  I&amp;rsquo;ll end up putting these out, chapter by chapter, in their own magazine, which won&amp;rsquo;t be released until each issue is done to my satisfaction and ready to roll. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current plan is to do both at once. I have a title picked out for the magazine in option B, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably secure the domain name for option A as well just in case. Lord knows my agoraphobia has kept me from getting to the post office in a timely manner more than once in my career; option A is probably the safest to ensure that I&amp;rsquo;m actually able to get these out there to all of you without you having to wait until my head&amp;rsquo;s in a good enough state to leave the house and deal with the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; hahahahahaha yeah about that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ve got good news and bad news. The good news is, Autumn ████████ and I are finally getting the hell out of Colorado. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to leave this shithole since nearly the minute I got here, and after multiple years of having setback after setback, it&amp;rsquo;s finally just about time for us to get out of Dodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that we&amp;rsquo;re moving this red-blooded dyed-in-the-wood Ozzie-Smith-loving Cardinals girl to Illinois, just outside of Chicago. You know, the home of the Chicago Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/em&gt;, I tell ya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0008/06.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0008/06.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Packin&#39; boxes. If you wanna judge my book collection, now&#39;s the time; I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;m gonna be able to unpack it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fun part about being a household made up of a found family consisting of two trans folk and a toothy barking fuzzball is that there&amp;rsquo;s not many places you can move where you won&amp;rsquo;t be risking getting shot at. We obviously can&amp;rsquo;t go back to my home state of Missouri, and Autumn&amp;rsquo;s from even further south in DeSantis Land so we&amp;rsquo;re definitely not moving to her neck of the woods. Thankfully, Illinois not only has trans protections but is also a true-blue trade union state, something that has been very clearly lacking in the state that has been desperately trying to live up to Senator Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s libertarian ideals since well before the release of Revengeance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m honestly looking forward to being back in the Midwest again, if for no other reason than the fact that the elevation here makes my skin flake up, the lack of humidity kills both of us and I miss my fuckin&amp;rsquo; rivers. Had we the cash, I&amp;rsquo;d have preferred to move back to Maine&amp;ndash;I lived there for about a year, and I honestly kind of grew to love it. Still miss Portland to this day. Maybe at some point we&amp;rsquo;ll have the money to end up back there, but for now, it&amp;rsquo;s back to the lower rents and muddy waters of the Mississippi River, where my accent won&amp;rsquo;t be out of place, my beater car won&amp;rsquo;t get rammed by idiots driving Teslas who are really angry that I don&amp;rsquo;t know who their father is, and the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t regularly get high enough to think Joe Rogan is onto something is a social faux pax in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Seriously, though, don&amp;rsquo;t expect me to root for the fuckin&amp;rsquo; Cubs. I ain&amp;rsquo;t doin&amp;rsquo; it. You can&amp;rsquo;t make me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sobriety-and-recovery&#34;&gt;SOBRIETY AND RECOVERY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, I&amp;rsquo;ll have hit a major milestone&amp;ndash;six months sober. I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally weighed in for the first time in a while, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally down to 155lbs&amp;ndash;last year in January, I weighed in at 215 after two years of relapsing on my eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past three years have been particularly rough, and to be frank I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I survived them. Finally getting sober and getting my eating disorder back under control is something that took an absurd amount of effort. I want to keep this post at least relatively light, so I won&amp;rsquo;t be going into it here, but I did write a bit about the past few years and trying to get a handle back on my life. &lt;a href=&#34;/post/0009/&#34;&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in a place where you can handle some heavier narratives, you can check it out here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s about all I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to in the studio for the past month. Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll have the radio schedule up for The Jazz Program and Talkie Time for the month of May, and probably shortly thereafter I&amp;rsquo;ll post a new installment of The Finer Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all, as always, for reading. You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;SARAH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://draculatheme.com/&#34;&gt;Dracula&lt;/a&gt; across most of my devices, but I honestly like the pastels of Rose Pine a lot better. If you saw older screenshots of my setups over the past year, though, I was probably using Dracula. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I almost cut this line, thinking it was too confrontational even for my radical ass, and then &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.advocate.com/politics/montana-seekins-crowe-daughter-suicide&#34;&gt;this story hit the news the same day I was editing this.&lt;/a&gt; If you wanted proof, here you go. Trust me, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it anymore than you do. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you somehow couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out which of the list applies here&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s the first one, honey. I&amp;rsquo;m paler than mayonnaise. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tertiary&#34;&gt;tertiary&lt;/a&gt; option and failure state C, where I just don&amp;rsquo;t release any of these books in any form, realize what&amp;rsquo;s good for me, stop drawing forever and take up a career as an underwater nuclear welder, bomb disposal expert, or something equally less hazardous to my health than being the weird fusion of gonzo journalist, underground cartoonist, and certifiable lunatic that I am. I don&amp;rsquo;t see that happening though. If I were smart enough to know what was good for me I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have survived this long. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten, or just never played MGS:R, Senator Armstrong is the state senator from Colorado. He also used the line &amp;ldquo;Make America Great Again&amp;rdquo; well before Orange Manbad ever made a bid for the US Presidency, and his nonsense is honestly a pretty on-the-nose reflection of the political beliefs and personal philosophies of most Colorado residents I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#007: An Old Interview (or, A Time Capsule To 2019 Sarah)</title>
      <link>/post/0007/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0007/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this-exactly&#34;&gt;What is this, exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While going through some old files on an old shared network drive trying to track down an old script I&amp;rsquo;m working on re-writing, I found this series of interview answers that I gave for a blog that wanted to interview me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that seems a strange way of doing things, it kind of is. It&amp;rsquo;s also more or less the norm on a lot of journalistic outlets nowadays, especially those that cater to small press books and records. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon in the slightest for blog-runners to simply send over a Google Doc of the same questions that they send literally everyone, copy and paste, and move onto the next grain to grind in the content mill. Some of them even edit the answers the folks they&amp;rsquo;re interviewing and add in secondary questions to break up the answers given in order to sound more conversational.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in my career, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly open about despising that kind of dreck. I know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; folks do it &amp;ndash; either you feed the algorithm or the algorithm removes your piece from the board. Putting effort and thought into these things takes a bit of time, and in a day and age where said time is at a premium I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;begrudge&lt;/em&gt; that section of our industry that refer to themselves as &amp;ldquo;content creators&amp;rdquo; over all. With that stated, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxDRmm6KlO7JyI6Wou3Xe1SayqWBxskIB&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve given my fair share of interviews in my time&lt;/a&gt;, and to me, an interview is meant to be a conversation first and foremost. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re pressed for time or not, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to talk to an artist about their work you should at least do the due diligence to ask at least one or two questions that show a willingness to interact with said work. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just being a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curmudgeon&#34;&gt;curmudgeon&lt;/a&gt; screaming at clouds here, but I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care that media coverage of my industry has kind of just devolved into copy-slinging for eyeballs, and I&amp;rsquo;m also fully aware that my barbed tongue isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly liked by SEO-minded copy-slingers either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to this one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be frank, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;which blog&lt;/em&gt; I originally filled this out for. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain it was a horror blog, and I was writing horror at the time, but I get the feeling looking over the questions they asked that I was never their target audience despite being a horror author who was being interviewed for said audience. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m going to hazard a guess that it was a blog I never should have been featured on, given the question about whether or not I utilize &amp;ldquo;pinterest boards&amp;rdquo; in my creative process. Either way, to my knowledge the interview never actually ran, I never heard back from the interviewer, and I was never informed that it was pulled from publication until I checked their site a few months after and saw that they just never bothered to let me know they weren&amp;rsquo;t going to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly four years since the creation date on this Google Doc, so in the interest of posterity, amusement, and time-capsuling a portion of myself, I&amp;rsquo;m posting a slightly edited version here.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also point out that, at the time, I was working on what was the original version of my graphic novel BARREN (which I am currently in the process of re-working and completing), and was planning on bringing back my old comic series, Tabula Rosetta, which had kind of just died after a mental collapse a half-year or so prior. I have not made a formal return to solo comics work since, save a few magazine spots over the past couple years, so it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to re-read this now as I&amp;rsquo;m working on both two books not written by me but am currently working on returning to solo comix work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s Sarah, circa 2019, screaming at clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-interview&#34;&gt;The Interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kind-of-books-do-you-like-to-write-or-have-you-written-if-you-have-written-several-books-do-you-have-a-favorite&#34;&gt;What kind of books do you like to write or have you written? If you have written several books, do you have a favorite?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve put out more than a few solid stories in my career (or so I’ve been told), but my favorites are the ones that elicit the most intense reactions. A good portion of the horror in my work does not come from the traditional “baddies of the week” format, but rather, the horrors of modern love, relationships, anxiety and trauma, and interpersonal dynamics; the monsters within rather than the monsters without.  As a result, my most intense and impactful stories come from exploring the type of interaction that produce the most dangerous monsters; when love is taken away, often through forces outside of mortal control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a direct result, most of the stories I write aren’t necessarily horror at all&amp;hellip;well, save the gratuitous dissections of psychological trauma, the blood and gore, the disturbingly intimate nature of the few autobiographical exerpts, and the body horror which stems from my personal experience of being transgender and having to live in a society that has things like Twitter and mirrors. They’re love stories, ghost stories, portraits of the human condition and of the hearts of mankind, and that’s exactly what makes them terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/01_2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/01_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/01_3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/01_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A three-page excerpt from Tabula Rosetta Issue 2 to kind of illustrate this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose if I had the distinct pleasure of an easier life, I could have easily been a romance novelist; however most of my experiences with the hearts of men (and women) can be roughly illustrated by a series of videos of car crashes, hence my work being squarely in the “horror” genre. I’d go back to writing comedy, but quite frankly I’m too busy crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-your-writing-process-playlists-snacks-quiet-something-else&#34;&gt;What is your writing process? Playlists, snacks, quiet, something else?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to set aside days to write; if I don’t, it doesn’t get done. Normally, when I have the spare seventy-or-so dollars to thrift a simple Core 2 Duo from a local ARC Thrift or Goodwill, I will set up a specific desk much like the one I had in my mid-twenties when I would spend my mornings puffing away at my meerschaum and drinking mediocre French pressed coffee and drowning myself in the sound of the keys and the waves of green upon my screen. I still haven’t set one up in the new place just yet, but I probably will come the end of the month. It’s nice to have that oasis, that place of respite, that a dedicated writing desk can provide.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The writing desk at my current digs, 2023. As you can see, I haven&#39;t changed much in almost four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem a tad bit like overkill, but I will often use my years of Linux experience to design a system with these applications and nothing else, forcing me into a distraction-free environment which enables me to drown myself in the work. I have a small cassette deck above my drawing table, and I will often put on records that friends of mine have worked on while I write. Occasionally, I’ll put on Radio Inter or some kind of French radio drama as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-your-editing-process-look-like&#34;&gt;What does your editing process look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Me holding one of my books which I set on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this, normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is a photograph of me holding one of my books which I&amp;rsquo;ve set ablaze. Fire not included, please provide your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-one-of-your-proudest-achievements-as-an-author&#34;&gt;What is one of your proudest achievements as an author?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven King once said that if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn&amp;rsquo;t bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, you are a talented writer. Every time that happens, I consider it a proud achievement, because fooling someone of Steven King’s caliber into thinking you know what you’re doing is a reason to open up that aged bottle you’ve been saving in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pick-one-of-your-books-now-if-you-were-dream-casting-it-for-hollywood-which-actor-would-play-your-mcs-and-why&#34;&gt;Pick one of your books. Now, if you were dream-casting it for Hollywood, which actor would play your MC(s) and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have licensed an absurd amount of what I have produced as Creative Commons BY-SA specifically to avoid Hollywood ever getting their grubby mits on my work and molly-coddling it into oblivion (see the Silent Hill movies for a head-meet-desk example of why I lean towards a hard no in regards to film adaptations), but if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick, I’m not going to stop at the main character. Hell no. I’m earning that bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re putting a first-year philosophy student in a room and giving him a copy of the finished version of “Barren”, Jung’s Red Book, a typewriter, all the acid he can handle, and no way to leave the room until he comes up with a screenplay adaptation. We’re snatching a bunch of high school theatre students and putting them on a Hollywood set, loading them up on sugar and pizza, and casting lots for roles per scene (every actor plays a different character in every single scene) so that none of them have any idea what’s going on or have the ability to care by the end of it. Then for the final &lt;em&gt;coup de grace&lt;/em&gt;, we’re pulling an Airplane! on this one and telling everyone that this terrifying work of artistic horror is meant to be a comedy. You get one take. Ham it up as much as you can. We’re upending The Room off its throne and I’m bankrupting your studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-scariest-book-youve-read-or-a-favorite-book-youve-read-this-year&#34;&gt;What is the scariest book you&amp;rsquo;ve read or a favorite book you’ve read this year?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading the news lately, and that’s pretty terrifying. As for my favorite book that I’ve read this year, well, that’s a tough call. I’ve been leafing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shedsimove.com/node/1000&#34;&gt;Shed Simove’s rewrite of Fifty Shades Of Grey&lt;/a&gt;, and I find it to be a refreshing adaptation and a great improvement on the original. Highly recommend it if you can find a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Unironically, I’ve been paging through Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Principles Of Orchestration”, Ozamu Dasai’s “No Longer Human”, and doing a readthrough of the Tibetan Book Of The Great Liberation for the umpteenth time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-have-a-favorite-author-who-is-it-and-why&#34;&gt;Do you have a favorite author? Who is it and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Le Carre. Hands down. I’m not even taking the piss on this one; I love spy novels, and John Le Carre is the GOAT. If you haven’t yet, read “The Spy Who Came In From The Cold”. The pacing is impeccable, the story is brutal and heartless, and the climax will wrench your heart out of your chest and stomp it down on the ground beneath the Berlin Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/04.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Read this. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-your-favorite-scary-novel-or-scary-movie-trope&#34;&gt;What is your favorite scary novel or scary movie trope?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I actually don’t like to consume horror as a genre. I much prefer spy novels on the few occasions where I read fiction, and it’s pretty rare that I read fiction at all. With that being stated, I do have a soft spot for taking the trope of the “straight man” and slapping it in a horror setting; a character who isn’t affected by the terror because he’s simply too tired, dim, oblivious, or uncaring to notice that the streets are collapsing and snakes are coming from the walls. Could be a direct result of industry burnout or just my own severe depression, but boy howdy can I relate to that as a concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-believe-in-ghosts-werewolves-vampires&#34;&gt;Do you believe in ghosts? Werewolves? Vampires?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a Tinder account, I do tend to get rather cranky once a month when the lunar cycle hits its peak, and I have had some conversations with certain types of people at conventions that have absolutely left me feeling like the life had been sucked out of me. So sure, why not? Hell, technically my ex-fiance counts as all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-you-ever-had-a-real-life-spooky-encounter-if-so-tell-us-about-it&#34;&gt;Have you ever had a real-life spooky encounter? If so, tell us about it!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far too many, to be quite honest. I’ve kept a large assortment of day jobs throughout my life, and nearly all of them&amp;ndash;over-the-road trucker, chef, sysadmin&amp;ndash;are made up of a very superstitious lot. However, my favorite one didn’t take place on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in and out of homelessness the majority of my adult life (hence why so many of my characters are transient and why a good many of the themes in my work revolve around a lack of safety), and there was a time when my (now-ex) wife&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I were looking for a place to stay the night. We stumbled upon a local extended stay, and decided to walk around the building a bit before heading in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rounded a corner and stumbled into a weird religious ceremony. That isn’t that uncommon where I’m from&amp;ndash;much of the documentary Jesus Camp takes place in my home state, and I myself was raised by a fundamentalist foster family&amp;ndash;and the setup was much the same as it usually was. A small crop of middle-aged women with knock-off 50’s hairdos, flannel button-ups, and that specific cut of terribly-fitting mom jeans that you’ll find at LCMS fish fries all throughout the Midwest were standing around a single little girl and an emaciated man in business casual who I assumed was the preacher. We expected to be able to walk around their evangelical nonsense and go about our business, but then two lines were uttered, one by the Slenderman wannabe in a foreign accent I couldn’t place, and one by the little girl in the creepiest posessed-little-girl-in-a-horror-movie voice you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the power of Satan will be with you always.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not attempt to walk past them. We just kinda looked at each other, noped out, ducked back around the corner, and bolted to the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-curate-writing-playlists-pinterest-boards-or-novel-aesthetic-collages-if-so-would-you-like-to-share-one-or-a-link-to-it&#34;&gt;Do you curate writing playlists, Pinterest boards, or novel aesthetic collages? If so, would you like to share one or a link to it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what those words mean. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0007/05.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0007/05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A rare photo of me, circa 2019, back in the days where I still had a collection of black metal band shirts. Yes, &amp;quot;Sertraline&amp;quot; refers to the band, not the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog do this to me once without sending me the edit, and it infuriated me to the point where I&amp;rsquo;ve never linked to that interview since. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read it, you probably know exactly which one. I have a pretty unique cadence, and if you know how I write you can kind of tell they butchered it. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original interview contained references to books which, due to life circumstances and my struggles with mental illness, never came out, as well as references to the guy I was dating at the time. Removing those references comprise the vast majority of the edits here, and the remainder of them are documented here in the footnotes. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo I sent with this interview of my writing desk from 2019 seems to have been glitched out to hell, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have the original version of it anymore, hence why my current desk is here instead. Which, for the record, sucks. I liked that desk. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, believe it or not, there was a point in time where I spent my days pretending to be a &amp;quot;straight&amp;quot; &amp;quot;man&amp;quot; and was regrettably in one of those &amp;quot;heterosexual marriage&amp;quot; things. Look, we all make mistakes when we&amp;rsquo;re young, aaight? &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original answer I gave went on to list some music I was listening to at the time, but to be quite frank my musical taste back then was utter ass and I&amp;rsquo;d rather not list them here out of embarassment. If you were curious, however, I did start that list with exactly those seven words. And hell, to this day I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what a &amp;ldquo;novel aesthetic collage&amp;rdquo; is supposed to be. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Polyhymnia was supposed to be a service dog for my autism and PTSD, but the training she was supposed to get never actually happened. So now she&amp;rsquo;s just my favorite dumbass who tries her best. Here&amp;rsquo;s some cute photos of her over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Not-quite-baby Poly, sunnin&#39; on my old sofa. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#006: Adventures In Thrift Store Tape Hunting: April 2023 Radio Programming Calendar</title>
      <link>/post/0006/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0006/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of April, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to tune in, &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;head on over to datafruits.fm/chat&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&amp;rsquo;re broadcasting this week&amp;hellip;well, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a bit of an interlude&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-recording-is-killing-the-music-industry-we-micd-your-tape-deck-so-you-can-help&#34;&gt;HOME RECORDING IS KILLING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, WE MIC&amp;rsquo;D YOUR TAPE DECK SO YOU CAN HELP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0006/01.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0006/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Me performing live&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Yours truly, in my natural habitat: staring at a Thinkpad while fucking about with DJ decks and making a tape player make funny noises. Still image taken from a video of a live set recorded in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I talked a bit about the early days of the tape trading traditions in the old time radio scene. This month, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take that and run in a slightly different direction (as I tend to do) and talk a bit about how how tape decks, pirate recordings, and both my works as a musician and my love of radio came about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been futzing about with tape decks for about as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been recording sounds. My first release as Coma Roulette has me mucking about with an old radio and a tape deck on various tracks (something that&amp;rsquo;s been a recurring theme throughout my sonic output, as you can see from this photo of me performing life as Shibito in 2021, sampling an old tape of Gregorian chant via an old karaoke box) and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a reputation for using sampled sounds in my work since the beginning. You might think a lot of this would come from my time in and around the Internet&amp;ndash;plunderphonics and pirate radio go hand in hand with warez and IRC channels, after all&amp;ndash;but most of my love affair with tape comes from something a bit more personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I always try to do when I&amp;rsquo;m in a new place is explore, and one of my first ports of call always seems to be either the local flea markets or the local thrift shops. You can tell quite a bit about a city and its inhabitants by what they&amp;rsquo;re willing to hawk you on consignment, and in multiple occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve had the distinct luxury of finding dubbed tapes. Whether they&amp;rsquo;re joints from local bands sold at the local music shop for a few dolars, old Dead tapes from local heads who have transcribed them by hand and are selling them for two bucks a pop, or old time radio recordings being left outside because no one wanted them,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tapes have always seemed to find me in my travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of memories attached to my very meager tape collection. Between the few albums I&amp;rsquo;ve released through labels I still have copies of, the small shelf of tapes I&amp;rsquo;ve done art for, and my racks of old-time radio recordings, and the random copies of tapes I found at thrift stores by musicians whose discographies I now own (some of whom I play on the radio for you every Tuesday!) those lil&amp;rsquo; plastic squares have always kind of accompanied me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of the radio, let&amp;rsquo;s get into the schedule for this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;march-2023-talkie-timejazz-program-schedule&#34;&gt;March 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0006/02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0006/02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tom Adams&#39; cover art for Endless Night by Agatha Christie.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This has nothing to do with the BBC4 version, I just love this cover art on this particular edition of the novel by the legendary Tom Adams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;april-4-2023&#34;&gt;April 4, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--agatha-christies-endless-night&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s Endless Night&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, property ownership&amp;rsquo;s expensive these days. Murdering your wife with cyanide capsules to get her inheritance isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly out of the question. I mean, have you &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; how high the rent is? Too damn high, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to Joy Wilkinson&amp;rsquo;s 2008 BBC4 adaptation of this absolute classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-presents-_first-of-the-month-listener-request-night_--lisafreak-takes-the-decks&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program Presents &lt;em&gt;First Of The Month: Listener Request Night&lt;/em&gt; : Lisafreak Takes The Decks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Listener Request night again, and we&amp;rsquo;re doing something special. Last week was chat member Lisafreak&amp;rsquo;s birthday, and I joked in the chat that I wish she&amp;rsquo;d have told me so I could have had something ready. Thankfully, I said, next week was Listener Request night, and so if we wanted to do a birthday show then I&amp;rsquo;d be more than happy to play whatever she&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, &lt;a href=&#34;/lisa.txt&#34;&gt;she had an entire playlist ready to go,&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s jam-packed with some fantastic stuff. We&amp;rsquo;ll be blasting it in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;april-11-2023&#34;&gt;April 11, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0006/03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0006/03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Alan Ladd as Dan Holiday&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Alan Ladd in a promotional poster for Box 13, looking like a stone cold badass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--box-13---triple-cross--three-to-die&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Box 13 - Triple Cross / Three To Die&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three&amp;rsquo;s usually a lucky number, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing lucky about anything if it involves Dan Holiday. It&amp;rsquo;s time for more episodes of Box 13 on Talkie Time, the show about a mystery novelist with a need for ideas and adventure, a penchant for getting himself into trouble and a PO box that just seems to keep getting filled with exactly that kind of trouble.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to Triple Cross (originally aired November 7, 1948) and Three To Die (originally aired June 2, 1948)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-bob-berg---new-birth-1978--another-standard-1997--short-stories-1987&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: Bob Berg - New Birth (1978) / Another Standard (1997) / Short Stories (1987)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horace Silver, Miles Davis, Chick Corea. If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard those names, congrats&amp;ndash;you&amp;rsquo;re not too far from Bob Berg. The Brooklyn-born tenor sax wielder recorded with a laundry list of post-bop and modern jazz household names in his long career, and helmed his fair share of records under his own group as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll be checking out two of his post-bop recordings in two separate decades in &amp;lsquo;78&amp;rsquo;s New Birth and &amp;lsquo;97&amp;rsquo;s Another Standard, as well as a smoother side of his stellar oeuvre that lands somewhere in the middle of both with 1987&amp;rsquo;s Short Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;april-18-2023&#34;&gt;April 18, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--the-adventures-of-sam-spade---string-of-death-caper--soap-opera-caper&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : The Adventures Of Sam Spade - String Of Death Caper / Soap Opera Caper&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that the jump from the pages of Dashiell Hammett&amp;rsquo;s crime novels to ABC&amp;rsquo;s radio crime lineup was as smooth and easy as a strong glass of bourbon on a PI&amp;rsquo;s desk. &lt;em&gt;The Maltese Falcon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;s Sam Spade has some of the most interesting stories in all of crime radio, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be airing two of them tonight&amp;ndash;specifically, &amp;ldquo;The String Of Death Caper&amp;rdquo; (originally airing February 2, 1951) and &amp;ldquo;The Soap Opera Caper&amp;rdquo; (originally airing February 16, 1951). Steve Dunne stars in the titular role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-tom-jones-pretends-to-be-an-american-for-two-hours-to-varied-but-amusing-results-tom-1970-darlin1981the-body-and-soul-of-tom-jones-1973&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: Tom Jones Pretends To Be An American For Two Hours, To Varied But Amusing Results-Tom (1970)/ Darlin&amp;rsquo;(1981)/The Body And Soul Of Tom Jones (1973)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0006/04.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0006/04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tom Jones&#39; bad-fitting shirt.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Someone get this legend a tailor. And probably some new buttons for that shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get a few things out of the way first, One, I unironically love Tom Jones. Whether you classify him into vocal jazz/crooner territory or not, you can&amp;rsquo;t argue exactly how fantastic and jazzy a lot of the compositions he appears on are (I&amp;rsquo;d like to submit his record &amp;ldquo;A-Tom-Ic Jones&amp;rdquo; as evidence here), and you also simply can&amp;rsquo;t argue with that vocal range. I&amp;rsquo;m playing him on The Jazz Program for the same reasons that we&amp;rsquo;ve featured both Astrud Gilberto and Portishead&amp;ndash;the former because, in my mind, crooner pop/exotica functions very well as a &amp;ldquo;gateway drug&amp;rdquo; to the more complex stuff,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the latter because this is my show, dammit, I play what I want, and my standards for what counts as jazz are looser than Tom Jones&amp;rsquo;s shirt on half his album covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two, Tom Jones is not American. He is not from down south, he&amp;rsquo;s not country, and despite what his multiple album covers with him sporting a full afro would have you believe, he&amp;rsquo;s not any kind of soul save plastic. Man&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Welsh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes the three records we&amp;rsquo;re playing tonight, in which he, in order&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;covers Elvis&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Polk Salad Annie&amp;rdquo;, a track which starts with him claiming that &amp;ldquo;some y&amp;rsquo;all never been down south&amp;rdquo;, and then proceeds with him telling you all &amp;lsquo;bout where &lt;em&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; from, which clearly is Louisiana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puts on a cowboy hat in the cover art and does his best impression of cowboy trucker&amp;rsquo;s music,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, finally, dons an afro that he thought work for much of the 70s and into the 90s and has cover artist Shel Starkman paint him like he&amp;rsquo;s about to drop the best soul-funk record you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard in your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;simultaneously infinitely amusing and incredible listens. Somehow, Atomic Jones unironically nails all three notes. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;april-25-2023&#34;&gt;April 25, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time-_cloak-and-dagger-night_---the-brenner-pass-story--the-people-in-the-forest&#34;&gt;Talkie Time: &lt;em&gt;Cloak And Dagger Night&lt;/em&gt; - The Brenner Pass Story / The People In The Forest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain&amp;rsquo;s 1946 book &amp;ldquo;Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS&amp;rdquo;, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I&amp;rsquo;ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While claming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s&amp;ndash;see also half of James Bond&amp;rsquo;s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it&amp;rsquo;s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our second night in our listen-through of the full series, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month&amp;rsquo;s edition&amp;ndash;namely, The Breener Pass Story and The People In The Forest, which aired on June 4, 1950 and June 11, 1950 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; CRIME JAZZ CRIME JAZZ CRIME JAZZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-presents-_crime-jazz-night_--crime-jazz-volume-2-discs-7-9&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program Presents &lt;em&gt;CRIME JAZZ NIGHT!&lt;/em&gt; : Crime Jazz Volume 2, Discs 7-9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Discs 7-9 of Volume 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the show lineup for this month! I&amp;rsquo;ll be back in a few days with a few other posts&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to write about that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to put up here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with a bunch of life stuff, including getting ready to finally leave Colorado and head off to greener pastures. I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;SARAH &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, finding a bunch of old recordings of old time radio that I saved from the garbage because the local consignment place didn&amp;rsquo;t feel they&amp;rsquo;d be worth selling should have been one of the first canaries in my ear screaming that I was not going to have a good time in Colorado. The first two examples are from Portland, Maine, a city which I still miss living in. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textual reason as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; trouble keeps following him is literally that Holiday ran a classified ad in the newspaper he used to work for saying, and I quote, &amp;ldquo;Adventure wanted, will go anywhere, do anything – write Box 13, Star-Times&amp;rdquo;. I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a pipe bomb in your mailbox, but he seemed to spend much of the series getting people who just wanted to knife him instead. Not the brightest idea a noir protagonist&amp;rsquo;s ever had, which is impressive given the genre he&amp;rsquo;s a protag in&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: look me in the eyes and tell me that Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas didn&amp;rsquo;t do more to get folks into jazz, lounge, crooner music, and even golden-age country than literally anything else in the past 10 years. You can&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>#005: Apparently I&#39;ve Been Banned From Instagram</title>
      <link>/post/0005/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick note - as of me editing this post on March 15, my Instagram account has been reinstated. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to actively avoid using it unless necessary, as I stated in this post, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also added &amp;ldquo;Share To&amp;rdquo; buttons to these blog pages and to the galleries if you wish to show off my work to some folks or talk about what I have to say on this blog. Either way, I appreciate you all reading, as usual. You&amp;rsquo;re amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not, as always. On with the post&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0005/01.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0005/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Instagram&#39;s ban notice.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; weeeeeeee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, uh. yeah. Sup, y&amp;rsquo;all. Title says it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to getting in trouble. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent half my life getting in trouble. Hell, to a lot of people I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trouble. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of half the reason I ended up in this field to begin with&amp;ndash;as I&amp;rsquo;ve stated in interviews before, there was a point in time where being a minor menace to society was a prerequisite to this profession and no one notified me when that switched to needing to be an advertiser-friendly influencer.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, usually I know what I did and I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly shy about owning up to it if I feel particularly bad about it or telling you to get bent if I don&amp;rsquo;t. And in this case, I&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing. I just hit the &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; button to put some new art up I was working on, and I got hit with a fun little message telling me my account was &amp;ldquo;disabled&amp;rdquo; and was pending a &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; to even get reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna lie here, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have no idea why I got hit with this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best guess&amp;ndash;if I could even approach a guess&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ndash;is one of two options. One, I have not had what anyone could consider a functional smartphone in months. I always post from their meagerly-featured web client when I have to post, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have &lt;em&gt;The App&lt;/em&gt; anywhere. I keep a &lt;a href=&#34;https://lineageos.org/&#34;&gt;LineageOS&lt;/a&gt; device around that I often forget to pay the bill on for two-factor authentication, taking photos of my work, and other such nonsense, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave the house. I also have a flip phone so the few people who would actually be worried if I disappeared into the woods can know vaguely where I am. That&amp;rsquo;s it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the Google Play store on a device that isn&amp;rsquo;t kept either off or in a Faraday cage, which is why the fun last request at the end of multiple 2FA verifications to let Instagram determine whether I&amp;rsquo;m human enough for their standards kind of unsettled the fuck out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0005/02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0005/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Instagram&#39;s ban notice.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; We&#39;re in the bad web now, kids &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there was like 30 minutes where I just kind of considered letting it die and not bothering. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly think I&amp;rsquo;m off center for not particularly wanting to participate in what some police offices consider standard booking procedure to prove to Mr. Metaverse that I&amp;rsquo;m not a fuckin&amp;rsquo; robot, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain that it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly off-key to assume they just want more pictures of human faces for their own AI bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Which brings me to the second and only other reason I can think of that I might have gotten banned: I have a habit of telling the numerous spambots that accost my feed to blow it out their ass, and there&amp;rsquo;s a distinct possibility that one of the scammers-with-a-thousand-faces decided to mass report me for either profanity or impersonation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hold the Metaverse&amp;rsquo;s version of a mug shot booking card with my middle and index finger so that I could flip the camera off in the selfie, so while I probably am not getting the account back I am at least getting the last jab in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be frank, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t return to mainstream social media even if my Instagram account gets reinstated. I know that fucks me as far as my work and livelihood goes, but I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the cost on my psyche. I cold-turkeyed Twitter after Musk took over, even though half the industry seems to only put open calls for work on that website despite the site&amp;rsquo;s open hostility to nearly every single marginalized group, including and especially trans folk.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My time on Twitter was mostly spent watching other creators constantly cannibalize each other and undermine each other in the fight for eyeballs, and it got to a point where that was not how I wanted to do this anymore. Musk letting the alt-right kids back on in droves kind of gave me the excuse to cut the cord. The plan was to eventually yeet Instagram as well once I had a decent foothold on getting this blog loaded up with things to read, but it looks like that decision has been made for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I do know that my account is &amp;ldquo;pending review&amp;rdquo;, but given the fact that the bit of research I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems to have given an answer of &amp;ldquo;a week to never&amp;rdquo; as to when I&amp;rsquo;ll have access to it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to behave as if it is permanently 86&amp;rsquo;d. If it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get re-instated, I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to let folks know when I have a new blog post up, but the pandemic was the last &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/September-that-never-ended.html&#34;&gt;variation upon a theme of the Eternal September&lt;/a&gt; that I have the patience to deal with in my lifetime, at least directly. I have joined a couple smaller social networks that specifically cater to illustrators, and when I have my account set up there I&amp;rsquo;ll probably share them here and add a &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; section to the navbar to hold them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0005/03.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0005/03.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Email Me gif from the golden age of Geocities.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Take it back to the good old days of the good web, baby. (Gif sourced from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gifcities.org&#34;&gt;Gifcities.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also most likely going to add some &amp;ldquo;Share to $OPEN_SOURCE_FORUM&amp;rdquo;-type button to the blog posts in the future when I can be bothered to work them into the code, and if I can find a way to do so that won&amp;rsquo;t end up with me getting bombarded with either spam or transphobic slurs I might add a comment section. I do want my work to be shared with those who want to read it, but to be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear from folks who want to use the comment section to willfully misinterpret what I have to say at best or insult me or try and sell me something at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, you can find me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pillowfort.social/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Pillowfort&lt;/a&gt;, a comfy old-school Tumblr clone with no NSFW ban, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cohost.org/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Cohost&lt;/a&gt;, a microblogging platform with about the same vibe. As of the time of pushing this article to the server, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any content on either yet, but I will soon. &lt;del&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly sure about whether or not I&amp;rsquo;m going to join Mastodon, but I will be adding a &amp;ldquo;Share on Mastodon&amp;rdquo; button to the blog soon enough.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minor editor&amp;rsquo;s note&amp;ndash;I found out that Rusty Hodge, the guy who founded Soma.FM and a large part of why I got into DJing on internet radio in the first place, hangs out on DEF CON&amp;rsquo;S Mastodon server. I also found out that DEF CON has a server, which in and of itself is tight as hell. So yeah, I kind of caved in and joined Mastodon. &lt;a href=&#34;https://defcon.social/@sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;You can find me on defcon.social here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of leaning towards the model I have already kind of put forth here&amp;ndash;if you enjoy my work and want to interact with me about it, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com/resume/bio/&#34;&gt;send something to the PO box&lt;/a&gt;, or simply find me at a convention or when I&amp;rsquo;m having a book signing or something. I love hearing from all of you and listening to your reactions to my work, but to be quite frank I would rather talk &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; you all about it than have what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about get muddied in the shallowness of a walled garden&amp;rsquo;s comment section. If I get emails with particularly interesting questions which I want to make sure to respond to, I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely toss them into a &amp;ldquo;letterbag&amp;rdquo; section on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work is how I communicate and interact with the world around me. It seems a fool&amp;rsquo;s game to limit your ability to communicate back to two hundred and fourty characters, especially with algorithms that monetize constantly pitting us all against each other. Time will tell how badly this fucks my career up, but for now, I suppose my move is not to play. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;s at least a somewhat winning one in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I appreciate having all of you along for the ride. You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; SARAH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple rants on why and how that entire switch was an awful move for both the medium and the majority of interesting creators, but that&amp;rsquo;s another rant for another time. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; approach a guess, to be honest. These algorithms don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have a thought process that falls in the realm of any kind of reasoning I&amp;rsquo;d consider human. And no, I don&amp;rsquo;t consider capitalist &amp;ldquo;growth mindset&amp;rdquo; nonsense or the walled-prison-type designs commonplace in the modern Web a part of any kind of reasoning I&amp;rsquo;d consider human. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitchwars.org/pitmad/&#34;&gt;Pitmad&lt;/a&gt; and half the links on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.creatoradvisor.com/category/job-postings/&#34;&gt;Comic Book Resources&lt;/a&gt; are some fairly decent examples of my point here. I&amp;rsquo;m not linking them here because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the job they&amp;rsquo;re doing&amp;ndash;all of the people running these are fantastic individuals, to the best of my knowledge/interactions with them&amp;ndash;but rather to illustrate this point. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>#004: What Is A Talkie, And What Does It Do?: March 2023 Radio Programming Calendar</title>
      <link>/post/0004/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/0004/</guid>
      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0002/05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; You might not like it, but this is what peak UI design looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of March, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to tune in, &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;head on over to datafruits.fm/chat&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&amp;rsquo;re broadcasting this week&amp;hellip;well, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a bit of an interlude&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-talkie-and-what-does-it-do&#34;&gt;WHAT IS A TALKIE, AND WHAT DOES IT DO?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Talkies&amp;rdquo;, as I call them, are basically exactly what it says on the tin&amp;ndash;radio dramas, usually older ones from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. You know how your gramma complains about how people are interrupting her TV stories? Well, take away the TV and add the radio and you&amp;rsquo;ve basically got the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And yes, I am basically a 75 year old woman trapped in a weird transfemme&amp;rsquo;s body. Now be a good kiddo and fetch me my pipe, Gramgram Sarah&amp;rsquo;s got some stories to tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://otrr.org&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0004/00.png&#34; alt=&#34;OTRR logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; These are your FRIENDS, they fight for RADIO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in love with radio talk shows for years now. As most of you know (seeing as you&amp;rsquo;re on the website that hosts my studio blog and professional portfolio) I work in professional illustration, specializing in sequential art and storytelling. What that means is that I spend a lot of my time staring at a drawing table making tiny lines on paper, with not a lot of time to watch TV or take my attention elsewhere. I&amp;rsquo;m also a noted advocate for open-source software, and not only have I never had a Spotify account but I&amp;rsquo;ve also never been arsed to check out any &amp;ldquo;podcasts&amp;rdquo; that required me to have a proprietary app or anything of the sort. Hell, for most of my life I&amp;rsquo;ve not even had a smartphone if I can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the magical work of the Old Time Radio Researcher&amp;rsquo;s group. These fine folks find their roots in the old days of tape trading. Back in the day, a lot of the only records of talk shows and those sorts of programs were thanks to home taping and bootleg audio recordings, ripped straight from the air. Eventually, as the years went on, these tape rips gave way to CD rips, then .mp3 files. Thing is, very few of these types of programs had any real classification system&amp;ndash;most folks wrote down the details of the show on the tape box or in a notebook, and everyone recorded them differently. There was also an issue of access&amp;ndash;not a lot of resources were available for the younger generation to enjoy these programs, or even have much of an idea as to what they were listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.otrr.org/&#34;&gt;Old Time Radio Researchers, or OTRR for short&lt;/a&gt;, fixed this by doing two things&amp;ndash;compiling their old tapes and uploading them to the Internet Archive for anyone to enjoy, and creating a catalogue of said tapes to make sure everyone had a record of what they were listening to, who it starred, and when it originally aired. I stumbled upon the radio drama collecting hobby through these fine folks a good few years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting recordings and doing my best to spread the word of old-time radio ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll have a few more words next month on the subject, but for now, here&amp;rsquo;s our schedule&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;march-2023-talkie-timejazz-program-schedule&#34;&gt;March 2023 Talkie Time/Jazz Program Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0004/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Frank Sinatra as Rocky Fortune&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Can you picture this fine gentleman as a professional layabout? ...Yeah, neither can I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-6-2023&#34;&gt;March 6, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--rocky-fortune---the-prize-fight-fix--honor-among-thieves&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Rocky Fortune - The Prize Fight Fix / Honor Among Thieves&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis Albert Sinatra was no stranger to either acting or radio&amp;ndash;the crooner had multiple incarnations of fifteen- to thirty-minute variety programs throughout his career and a good many fantastic films&amp;ndash;but the most interesting of his radio appearances (at least to me) is his role as Rocky Fortune, a frequently unemployed problem solver who shows up and solves crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that seems like a bit of an underwhelming elevator pitch, it is&amp;ndash;to be frank, the most fascinating part of the whole thing is that it stars The Chairman Of The Board as a murder-busting layabout. Slot literally anyone else in that role and you&amp;rsquo;d have had a recipe for middling reviews at best and a stinker at worst. Thankfully for all of us, you can&amp;rsquo;t keep Ol&amp;rsquo; Blue Eyes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-presents-_first-of-the-month-listener-request-night_--slim-galliard---laughing-in-rhythm-box-set-discs-1-2&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program Presents &lt;em&gt;First Of The Month: Listener Request Night&lt;/em&gt; : Slim Galliard - Laughing in Rhythm (Box Set), Discs 1-2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a decent amount of requests for features since starting this show years ago. In its early days before the single-artist-feature format we do now, I&amp;rsquo;d simply slot in tracks as requested if I could fit them in, but with this new format I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do something a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting this month, the first Tuesday will see the First Of The Month Listener Request Night, where I run a feature on an artist suggested by listeners in the Datafruits chat. This month&amp;rsquo;s inaugural request comes from Datafruits chat member river, with two hours of Slim Galliard&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Laughing In Rhythm&amp;rdquo; multi-disc career-spanning set from Proper Box UK. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the first two disks and&amp;ndash;who knows?&amp;ndash;maybe play a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-13-2023&#34;&gt;March 13, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--mercury-theatres-the-campbell-playhouse---the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Mercury Theatre&amp;rsquo;s The Campbell Playhouse - The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0004/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cover art to Le temps passe&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; One of the most unsettling cover art pieces in all of trip-hop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 30, 1938, Orson Welles and his troupe at the Mercury Theater repertory company broadcast one of the most infamous radio plays ever aired. Their interpretation of H.G. Welle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The War Of The Worlds&amp;rdquo;, interpreted live on-air as a faux real-world emergency broadcast, was so realistic that the cops got called, multiple small towns went into states of panic, the FCC nearly barred them from the air&amp;ndash;and earned them a sponsorship from the Campbell Soup Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First airing on December 9, 1938, The Campbell Playhouse aired the same kind of programming that made The Mercury Theater On The Air famous, but now with cash flow. A masterclass in foley, radio drama, and narrative adaptation alike, the entire series is absolutely worth a listen. We&amp;rsquo;ll be airing their interpretation of Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&amp;rsquo; tonight, which originally aired on November 12, 1939.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-zofka---bikini--chocolat--2000-2015-le-temps-passe&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: Zofka - Bikini / Chocolat / 2000-2015 Le temps passe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for making my audiences listen to whatever I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by at any given moment. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that as a deterrent, mind&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I have decent taste, and part of why I got into radio in the first place is to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve found with all of you. This is very much one of those episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of online radio pioneers soma.fm, and often have one of their &amp;ldquo;stations&amp;rdquo; (read: curated playlists by a selection of fantastic DJs) playing while I work. Zofka has at least one track on their &amp;ldquo;Illinois Street Lounge&amp;rdquo; station, and it&amp;rsquo;s that track that sent me down a rabbit hole of trip-hop and nu-jazz. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing three of their records tonight, including the retrospective &amp;ldquo;2000-2015 Le temps passe&amp;rdquo; which has the dubious honor of having one of the most unsettling pieces of cover art that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen on a trip-hop record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-20-2023&#34;&gt;March 20, 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;talkie-time--yours-truly-johnny-dollar---the-rat-pack-matter--the-wayward-fireman-matter&#34;&gt;Talkie Time : Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar - The Rat Pack Matter / The Wayward Fireman Matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Dollar is one of the more interesting of the leading men in the radio noir genre for a couple reasons. Not only is he not a PI&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s an investigator for an insurance company, often going out to investigate &amp;ldquo;accidental deaths&amp;rdquo; and finding them more often than not to be murders&amp;ndash;but he&amp;rsquo;s had more people voice him than nearly any other character in the history of radio noir dramas. You&amp;rsquo;d think that a downside at first glance, but every single actor who takes up the mantle plays the character very well in their own unique way. Tonight, we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a listen to Bob Readick&amp;rsquo;s version of the wielder of the action-packed expense account, with two cases to die for&amp;ndash;The Rat Pack Matter and The Wayward Fireman Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-jazz-program-the-grateful-dead-and-ornette-coleman---live-at-oakland-alameda-county-coliseum-22393&#34;&gt;The Jazz Program: The Grateful Dead And Ornette Coleman - Live at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, 2/23/93&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grateful Dead might not be known for their proximity to jazz, but they toured with more than a few jazz legends in their time. Jerry and the crew have shared the stage with the likes of Branford Marsalis (fantastic sax player, brother of Wynton Marsalis, the world-famous trumpeteer, and son of Ellis Marsalis Jr., pianist extrordinare), David Murray (New York based legendary saxophonist), and Charles Lloyd (west-coast based flautist and tenor saxophonist), as well as tonight&amp;rsquo;s feature&amp;ndash;the legendary Ornette Coleman. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing a live tape from the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, a night that featured Ornette opening the show with Jerry joining him onstage later on and Ornette returning the favor near the end of the Dead&amp;rsquo;s set. This set is an absolute must listen for jazz cats and deadheads alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain&amp;rsquo;s 1946 book &amp;ldquo;Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS&amp;rdquo;, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I&amp;rsquo;ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While claming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s&amp;ndash;see also half of James Bond&amp;rsquo;s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it&amp;rsquo;s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz&amp;ndash;both the moniker denoting the weird hodge-podge of genres from lounge to exotica that acompanied the numerous neo-noir and police drama epics that haunted cinemas in the &amp;rsquo;60s and &amp;rsquo;70s, and the now-defunct &lt;a href=&#34;https://thecrimelounge2.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;series of compilation records hosted on Blogspot and lost due to the demise of Rapidshare.&lt;/a&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re talking about the latter in this case. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, we&amp;rsquo;ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Discs 4-6 of Volume 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s our schedule for this month. Thanks in advance for tuning in; hope you enjoy the show. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon with a bit of information about Talkie Time, as well as our schedule for the month of February.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thanks as always for reading; you&amp;rsquo;re amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0003/01.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0003/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The corkracks, sometime in the middle of production of Our Lady Maven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey y’all! It’s your favorite dork, back at it again. I’ve just finished up the final touches on Issue 1 of Our Lady Maven at long last, and I’ve finally got time for a bit of a breather to write a bit about what I’ve been working on, what I’ve been reading when I have a second to sit down and read, what I’ve been listening to in the studio, what I’ve been playing in my wee small hours of the morning before I pass out for the day, and (for those few of you who are curious for reasons other than wondering “what the fuck is wrong with her”) what I’ve been smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this will be a regular column, but I fully intend to make it one if I can. I started doing this blog thing to talk about things that aren’t exactly “marketable” “content” to begin with and to give a bit of context as to my thought process as I go through my craft, so I can’t think of a better idea for a regular feature. I tend to align with the school of thought that holds that “death of the author” is most often misused as a cop-out by milquetoast moderates who don’t want to interrogate or even bother thinking about the moral implications of continuing to uphold the &amp;ldquo;merits&amp;rdquo; of middling fiction written by maladapted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mooncalf&#34;&gt;mooncalves&lt;/a&gt; (looking at you, Harry Potter fans), much less the lives and contexts of somewhat more morally ambiguous (and usually queer, non-white, or other marginalized) creators who spend their lives crafting much more complex or fucked-up narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also of the school of thought that holds that the spirit of a creative work is inseparable from the context it resides in, which very much includes the thoughts, times and places the creator was working through at the time. Quite frankly, on a personal level I’ve found that the things I’ve been up to outside of putting pen to paper drastically influence my thoughts and way of being while I’m working on any given piece, and while a good portion of those things tend towards the negative a good bit of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading, listening to, playing through, and observing works its way in as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re still here, and are cool with kickin&amp;rsquo; back for a bit and listen to me ramble about shit I find cool&amp;hellip;you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, &amp;lsquo;cuz this is what this column&amp;rsquo;s gonna be. Oh, and if you read through this and have some records, games, books, or movies for me to check out, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;email me at sarah (at) sarahallenreed (dot) com&lt;/a&gt; and hit me with those recs. I always love hearing from all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0003/02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0003/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Game in progress&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;d tell you what&#39;s going on here, but I&#39;d have to resort to things that could be considered violent or cruel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-working-on&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN WORKING ON&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Lady Maven has occupied the majority (if not the entirety) of my mindshare for the past few months, and at some point I fully intend to do a full write-up on it. It&amp;rsquo;s been a labor of love from myself and &lt;a href=&#34;http://hexadecim8.com&#34;&gt;Em&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s been multiple years in the making, and now that it&amp;rsquo;s finally out the door I can honestly say I&amp;rsquo;m more than content with the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oh, and if you wanna pick up a copy, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourladymaven.com/shop/&#34;&gt;head on over to the webstore Em put together and go snag one&lt;/a&gt;, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the series yet but would like to, &lt;a href=&#34;/comics/samplestory4&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little teaser right here on the site&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally been sitting down to finish up the re-drafting and re-working of my graphic novel BARREN, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/CjVaV5LO-PW/&#34;&gt;which I received a grant for thanks to the magnificent Annie Koyama last year.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a slog, to be honest. The best thing about re-working a script you wrote years ago is that you realize that younger you had a lot of great ideas but fucked a lot of shit up. From the looks like I have some reading to do to get some shit right, grounded, and believable before sitting down to rework the script. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;ll be worth the wait. I&amp;rsquo;m damn good at what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, there&amp;rsquo;s been at least one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in between bouts of inks and moments of rest and recovery that has been a unique challenge. If you &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;follow me on Github&lt;/a&gt;, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed much in the way of new things updated, but you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely seen the little green code commit thingy get the occasional ping. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a secret project that Autumn ████████ and I have been working on, and it&amp;rsquo;s in a format of storytelling that I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed around with but never made a dedicated effort to do anything with. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a good minute before I have anything to show for my labors here, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll let the screenshot to the left here speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-listening-to&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN LISTENING TO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s one little section here on this column you&amp;rsquo;ll always see, it&amp;rsquo;s this one. I literally don&amp;rsquo;t stop listening to music. I have a flip phone and don&amp;rsquo;t bother with social media these days save having &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Instagram for work&lt;/a&gt;, but I keep my old smartphone around with a pair of wireless Audio Technica noise-cancelling over-the-ears every time I leave the house so I can keep the jams going, and given the fact that I work from home through the night and sleep during the day I&amp;rsquo;m shocked my neighbors don&amp;rsquo;t complain nearly as much as they have the right to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be a long, long list if I were to type out everything that&amp;rsquo;s held my interest over the past couple months, but here&amp;rsquo;s a short list of records I&amp;rsquo;ve had blasting on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jonsafari/mocp&#34;&gt;mocp&lt;/a&gt; over the past bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dean-martin---like-never-before&#34;&gt;DEAN MARTIN - LIKE NEVER BEFORE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one travesty in this world, it is that it is nearly impossible to legally (or illegally, for that matter) track down Dino&amp;rsquo;s back catalogue in DRM-free form. I don&amp;rsquo;t have Spotify or any streaming services, and I adamantly refuse to pay for anything of the sort aside from the occasional Bandcamp purchase. With those restrictions in play, the only place I&amp;rsquo;ve found to track down the Rat Pack&amp;rsquo;s most quintessentially Italian member is what I have to assume is his estate&amp;rsquo;s official Youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0003/03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Records one through four in this little list. One of these things is not like the other, one of these things just doesn&#39;t belong...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thank god for that, because for as much of a Sinatra fangirl as I am Ol&amp;rsquo; Blue Eyes is in a perpetual dead fuckin&amp;rsquo; heat for &amp;ldquo;favorite Rat Pack member&amp;rdquo; with Dino. I absolutely love his old records, and highly recommend this one, &amp;ldquo;Amore&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;My Woman, My Woman, My Wife&amp;rdquo; if you need more crooners in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: I Ran All The Way Home, &amp;lsquo;Til I Find You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arovane---atol-scrap&#34;&gt;AROVANE - ATOL SCRAP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do love me some IDM. I often credit the genre for being the reason I got into making music in the first place, and this album&amp;ndash;originally released all the way back in 2000&amp;ndash;was absolutely on the list of &amp;ldquo;reasons I started&amp;rdquo;. Between this record, Plaid&amp;rsquo;s Not For Threes and a few select Aphex Twin and Outlier Recordings pics, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a playlist worth of records I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to for the past ten years plus that I put on whenever I really need comfort food to buckle down and focus to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: Just listen to the whole thing all the way through. It&amp;rsquo;s an atmospheric IDM album, that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;combichrist---what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-you-people&#34;&gt;COMBICHRIST - WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know this one&amp;rsquo;s a bit out of place on this graphic next to Dino and Bill Evans. I also contain multitudes, so you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard this record thanks to some goth kids I went to high school with before I got kicked out, and I&amp;rsquo;ve very occasionally used it in the same way investment bankers use amphetamines; i.e., if I need a kick in the ass and a wakeup call, downing an energy drink and blasting Andy LaPlegua screaming about how you&amp;rsquo;re a piece of shit and he&amp;rsquo;s going to kick your ass definitely helps, but it&amp;rsquo;s not something I&amp;rsquo;d turn to unless I absolutely fuckin&amp;rsquo; have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit a good bit of the lyrics didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly age well at best or are morally abhorrent at worst (see also the weirdly fascist-allusions-for-the-sake-of-muh-edge on &amp;ldquo;Fuck That Shit&amp;rdquo;, a track I always end up skipping), but then again 99% of industrial-adjacent acts from the 2000s and early 2010s find themselves in the same boat. (Looking at you, Mindless Self Indulgence.) I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a skip if that&amp;rsquo;s not something you&amp;rsquo;re willing to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: Get Your Body Beat, Deathbed, Electrohead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bill-evans-trio---portrait-in-jazz&#34;&gt;BILL EVANS TRIO - PORTRAIT IN JAZZ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Evans at his finest. Back before The Jazz Program was structured in the &amp;ldquo;listening party&amp;rdquo; format it is now, I used to have a monthly feature I called the &amp;ldquo;Artist Spotlight&amp;rdquo;, which basically was the current show format on the first Tuesday of every month. (The remaining shows were mixes of whatever I wanted to throw on that week, with no real theme to them). For the last few months of 2022, I decided to just embrace the sadness I always feel during the holidays and took up the October, November, and December slots with the records I always listen to when I&amp;rsquo;m miserable and need to sob it out. Bill Evans was the second choice of the three&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and if memory serves, Portrait In Jazz was the first record on the docket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill&amp;rsquo;s catalogue isn&amp;rsquo;t just a depression listen for me, however&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s chock full of the finest piano jazz records ever produced in the Western hemisphere. (Japan definitely gives us multiple runs for our money, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get to that when I get around to gushing about Ryo Fukui.) This album&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;What Is This Thing Called Love?&amp;rdquo; is one of my favorite versions of the standard by a country mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: What Is This Thing Called Love?, Blue In Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Records five through eight in this little list. I want to point out that I put this graphic together at about thirty minutes past my usual bedtime and I did not notice the awkward placement going on in the...er, bottom there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;editors---an-end-has-a-start&#34;&gt;EDITORS - AN END HAS A START&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got introduced to Editors in two less-than-stellar ways. First, through enjoying the first half of their 2018 record Violence and then being utterly underwhelmed with the second half, and second, through being gobsmacked at the news of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stereogum.com/2184148/editors-blanck-mass-member-heart-attack/music/&#34;&gt;permanent edition of experimental noise/electronic musician Blanck Mass to their lineup&lt;/a&gt; with the release of 2022&amp;rsquo;s album EBM. I still haven&amp;rsquo;t checked that record out and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to. The idea of noisier, edgier screamy joints mixed in with sad-boy post-punk offshoots doesn&amp;rsquo;t resonate as well with those of us who remember Myspace. I still have occasional moments where I vaguely remember Breathe Carolina exists&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I throw up a little in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whatever they&amp;rsquo;re on these days, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to listening to their first three records during the past few months in the studio, and to be quite frank I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a record that&amp;rsquo;s hit a nerve quite like this one in a while. &amp;ldquo;The Weight Of The World&amp;rdquo; had the dubious honor of being one of the very few pieces of media that has made me tear up, and the rest of the album is as cacophonously cathartic as that track. When I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sleepingvillagereviews.com/olde-reviews/let-the-waves-have-their-way-on-interpol-and-black-metal-a-retrospective-by-sarah-allen-reed&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let The Waves Have Their Way&amp;rdquo; for online metal mag Sleeping Village&lt;/a&gt; about Interpol&amp;rsquo;s relation to the closure and comfort present in both black and post-black metal&amp;rsquo;s most violently soothing moments and the work of New York&amp;rsquo;s bleakest foursome, I honestly could have written about this record in a different universe where I shoplifted this record instead of Our Love To Admire. Turn it up and let it wash over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: The Weight Of The World, When Anger Shows, Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;massive-attack--mezzanine&#34;&gt;MASSIVE ATTACK : MEZZANINE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need me to give this record an introduction, you either are so young that you missed an entire generation&amp;rsquo;s worth of influences or you&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten into trip-hop for reasons that are far beyond my understanding. Let me put it this way&amp;ndash;there is a very good reason an extended cut of the first track is the menu music for cult classic Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines. The record &lt;em&gt;reeks&lt;/em&gt; of smoked-out clubs, sinister motives, and the sensation of wrestling with your most sickening inner thoughts and losing miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say more, but experiencing this record will hasten your understanding of it far more than any words or clever writing I could give you. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard it, do yourself a favor&amp;ndash;find a copy, plug it into your stereo, and go take a night drive at one in the morning. It&amp;rsquo;ll click for you. Given the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m a nocturnal neurotic who wakes up at four in the afternoon and don&amp;rsquo;t go to bed until six in the morning, this night beat record fits perfectly in my standard rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: Angel, Inertia Creeps, Risingson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;placebo---sleeping-with-ghosts&#34;&gt;PLACEBO - SLEEPING WITH GHOSTS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve bounced off of this band for most of my life. Multiple important people in my life have sworn by this English twosome (looking at you, Penpen and Autumn) but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really found a decent entry point into their discography that meshes with my taste. That changed this past month, as I started diving back into snowboarding-arcade romp SSX 3 for the first time since I was a kid (we&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in the video games section) and found &amp;ldquo;The Bitter End&amp;rdquo; on the impeccibly curated soundtrack next. My collection contains more than a few discographies I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired for people I care for, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to locate the record that track is found on and the whole thing became an immediate repeated spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been listening to this as I write this up. The whole thing careens past at a speed just over &amp;ldquo;out of control&amp;rdquo; when it&amp;rsquo;s not cozying up to your ear on tracks like &amp;ldquo;Something Rotten&amp;rdquo; and seductively slinking around with wa-wa pedals and barely whispered vocals that sound something out of the previously mentioned Massive Attack&amp;rsquo;s sonic vocabulary. There&amp;rsquo;s also more than a couple heartfelt tracks like &amp;ldquo;Special Needs&amp;rdquo; that honestly makes a teenage me&amp;ndash;a fucked up kid that got lost in the system who ended up getting stuck with an IEP and a smorgasbord of psych meds I didn&amp;rsquo;t need instead of recieving any kind of help or being given any real chance for success&amp;ndash;feel seen. Once you put the entire package together, it makes me wish it was summer again so I could go skateboarding and get lost in the music and the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: The Bitter End, Ashtray Girl, Something Rotten, Special Needs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-mars-volta---amputecture&#34;&gt;THE MARS VOLTA - AMPUTECTURE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always going to be some consistent themes in my listening habits, and &amp;ldquo;something something Omar Rodruigez-Lopez&amp;rdquo; is one of them. Best part about that is, I&amp;rsquo;m never going to run out of side projects of his to gush over. The man has never made a single bad record in his life, and I&amp;rsquo;m counting my personal least favorite of his (Bosnian Rainbows) in that. Even my least favorite project of his has its only studio album scoring at least a 7 out of 10 to me.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the many joys of breaking hardware--custom boot screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, Amputecture was particularly formative to me as a musician and songwriter, and aside from two of his self-produced efforts (Xenophanes and Solar Gambling) and one other TMV record (Frances The Mute) this is probably the record I return most frequently to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended tracks: Asilos Magdalena, Tetragrammaton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-playing&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN PLAYING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly a big gamer, and a lot of that is due to life circumstance&amp;ndash;most of my twenties was spent either without a consistent place to crash or living out of vehicles for months at a time, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to plug in a Playstation in a Corolla. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even own my first seventh-generation console until I bought an Xbox 360 at a Goodwill in late 2019 for half of what it was probably worth.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed game consoles that were even remotely modern as a kid either, and so a lot of games that were formative storytelling experiences for a lot of my peers were things I never got to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, working for a brief time at the electronics arbitrage desk at a recycling center during the pandemic &lt;a href=&#34;/comics/samplestory3/&#34;&gt;(an experience that insipred &amp;ldquo;I Am Starting To Empathize With Bukowski&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/a&gt; enabled me to get a couple decently-powered (if ten years old at the time I bought them) machines at cost. One of those was a Dell all-in-one which I promptly slapped on top of an old box radio that I had gutted, installed a low-end Logitech speaker system into the box, and turned it into what I usually refer to as &amp;ldquo;The Jukebox&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not what you&amp;rsquo;d called a beast, but as of late I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out how to get the poor thing to run a few decent emulators. I also somehow scraped together the cash in 2021 to snag myself a used 2DS XL, which I of course immediately rooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for a good year or so now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a point to try and re-visit a bunch of gaming stories that I never got to experience outside of Let&amp;rsquo;s Plays for the first time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing over the past couple months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jake-hunter-ghost-of-the-dusk-3ds&#34;&gt;JAKE HUNTER: GHOST OF THE DUSK (3DS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love me some visual novels for the same reason I love me some detective fiction. I love a good noir-tinged romp, I adore a good mystery, and to be frank I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for shite tropes. Snatcher is one of my favorite games of all time and is one of the reasons &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/CoMUs_ROWng/&#34;&gt;why I have an &amp;ldquo;Outer Heaven&amp;rdquo; flag on my wall.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0003/06_1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0003/06_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They say if you look real hard at Jake Hunter&#39;s alcohol-beaten liver you&#39;ll find the codec number for the maître d&#39; of a certain nightclub in downtown Neo Kobe that sells buffalo meat. Or whale meat. Y&#39;know, whichever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a huge fan of the Jake Hunter series ever since I discovered the first localization on the original DS, and was absolutely stoked when I found a copy of this volume of stories for the 3DS. Dripping with charm, interesting (and at times unbearably tropy) characters, and a bunch of relatively well-put together puzzles&amp;ndash;with a few notable exceptions, including an infuriating &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haggardhawks.com/post/moon-logic&#34;&gt;moon-logic&lt;/a&gt; puzzle in the morgue in a later chapter of the first story in the collection), Ghost Of The Dusk is as much of a favorite waiting-room holdover as any old paperback I could stuff in my purse. Plus, the whole thing is chock full of references and allusions to other thriller/detective tropes, including the obligatory genre name-drops of works of Marlowe and other golden-era crime novelists and a few more obscure and occasionally region-specific ones. My personal favorite is what I have to assume is a direct allusion to the aforementioned SNATCHER, with Jake Hunter ordering a glass of &amp;ldquo;Napoleon&amp;rdquo; within the first few lines of Chapter One&amp;ndash;a bottle of which is a key item in a specific puzzle in Kojima&amp;rsquo;s classic take on the detective adventure genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few amusing bumps in translation&amp;ndash;including the strange &amp;ldquo;localization&amp;rdquo; choice to repaint all of the &lt;em&gt;very clearly&lt;/em&gt; Yakuza members as Italian mobsters and somehow forgetting to change both their character models and the backgrounds of the environments you find them in, which are obviously textbook Yakuza regional offices to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s bothered playing the Sega series of the same name&amp;ndash;but they honestly only add to the charm. That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, seeing as tropey charm is this game&amp;rsquo;s bread and butter. Hell, the button you press to get a hint from the player character as to what to do or where to go next is literally the &amp;ldquo;smoke&amp;rdquo; button. You read that correctly. Press the L button (which is mapped to a literal graphic of a pack of smokes in the GUI) and Jake lights up a smoke (or doesn&amp;rsquo;t, if you&amp;rsquo;re in somewhere he deems he&amp;rsquo;d get in trouble for doing so) and tells you what to do next. Absolutely fantasic. 10/10. No notes. Every game should have this button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ssx-3-gamecube&#34;&gt;SSX 3 (GAMECUBE)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fuckin&amp;rsquo; love extreme sports games. I can barely battle my way through a stairset on a skate deck (something that, for some reason, has never made me lose my love for longboarding) but I adore the freedom and arcade-iness of anything that puts a board or bike under you and lets you tear your way through a city with fun sound effects whenever you land a trick. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thugpro.com/&#34;&gt;THUGPRO&lt;/a&gt; has been an old favorite of mine since the days when I lived in my van, and I&amp;rsquo;d log on wherever I could track down a public Wifi network and skate a few hours away. I&amp;rsquo;ve played through nearly all of the rest of the Tony Hawk franchise as well and even (mostly successfully) stumbled my way through SKATE on the 360. With that in mind, it should be no surprise that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of SSX3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few sports games of this time period bothered with this kind of expansive world&amp;ndash;hell, Tony Hawk&amp;rsquo;s Underground released literally seven days after this one&amp;ndash;but SSX3 takes the interesting tracks and fun designs of Tricky and slams them all into three interconnected peaks. There&amp;rsquo;s no loading zones whatsoever&amp;ndash;if you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked all three peaks, you can literally snowboard from the top of Peak 3 at the very pinnacle of the mountain all the way to the bottom of Peak 1 at the base. Unlocking all three peaks, however, takes a good bit of progression. Thankfully, it&amp;rsquo;s (mostly) very fun progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0003/07.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0003/07.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CUZ IT&#39;S EASYYYYY ONCE YA KNOW HOW IT&#39;S DONE YA CAN&#39;T STOP NOW IT&#39;S ALREADY BEGUUUN IT&#39;S THE FEEELIIIIIN RUNNIN THROUGH YOUR BOOOOONES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the controls can feel barely on rails at best and completely out of your control at worst, the game&amp;rsquo;s speed, intensity, and expansiveness leads to a very fun fuck-offable experience. A good portion of the controls are questionable at best (I had to remap the &amp;ldquo;reset&amp;rdquo; button, designed to put you back on the track if you fell off, away from the Y button on my controller and onto the Select button because I kept hitting the thing in the middle of races and screwing up my runs&amp;ndash;something that&amp;rsquo;s mapped in that exact way on the PS2 controller that actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a Select button for a very good reason) and the AI the computer controlled players have for race modes cheats like hell, but the entire experience is absolutely a blast. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, the game comes packed with one of the most entertaining soundtracks this side of the Burnout franchise. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZrecTLpg7CG1ICEXiEZf0JCyBTr0xYW7&#34;&gt;Placebo, Dan The Automator, Yellowcard, The Faint, Thrice, Chemical Brothers&amp;hellip;.the entire thing just blasts&lt;/a&gt;, and I have found myself staying up well past the sunrise just jamming along with The Bitter End or Jerk It Out while busting out tricks that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be physically possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you need is &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt;, man. And this game has &amp;lsquo;em in spades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;resident-evil-4-gamecubeps2&#34;&gt;RESIDENT EVIL 4 (GAMECUBE/PS2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be honest, I bounced right the fuck off this one. &lt;a href=&#34;playlist?list=PLaSPgE4K0SB1MyNFxDny3igpCwMRdPOIO&#34;&gt;Supergreatfriend&amp;rsquo;s recent Lets Play of the Oculus port&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorite fall-asleep-to Youtube playlists of the past year, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve tried various early titles from the series in the past I could not get past the clunkiness of the tank controls and my own blatant incompetence at handling them. So, when I figured out that Gamecube emulation worked on the Jukebox (albeit at a crawl for certain titles), I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give this one a shot. Turns out, the Gamecube emulator somehow figured out how to lag on, of all things, cutscenes. Reeeally need to get a better computer for the Jukebox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the PS2 port ran fine, and&amp;hellip;.well, to be honest, as someone used to modern twin-stick controls, I could not get past the initial opening segment. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the PC port coupled with a couple mods allows for a bit more of a modern control setup, and I may try that, but as for now I&amp;rsquo;m still stuck on remembering that the right stick doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly control where the camera points in any manner that&amp;rsquo;s remotely permanent&amp;hellip;and that the knife controls like the gun in first person, which means moving the stick upwards aims the knife upwards for some reason&amp;hellip;and that you can&amp;rsquo;t move while using the knife&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tea party time with the besties, might ascend to heaven and save the world later idk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to get back to you on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fantasy-life-3ds&#34;&gt;FANTASY LIFE (3DS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me. Best way I can describe it is &amp;ldquo;Animal Crossing meets an MMO without the online connection&amp;rdquo;, and while normally that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be up my alley whatsoever this particular little &amp;ldquo;casual romp&amp;rdquo; has slowly been taking over my life for the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple&amp;ndash;you have twelve sets of jobs&amp;ndash;cleverly called Lifes in game, complete with title-case L&amp;ndash;ranging from typical fare like &amp;ldquo;mercenary&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hunter&amp;rdquo; to left-field choices like &amp;ldquo;seamstress&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;cook&amp;rdquo; (which I of course picked). That might sound like there&amp;rsquo;s a few that are less fun to play, but even the latter titles find ways to be challenging. The &amp;ldquo;cook&amp;rdquo; job has you working in a restaurant making everything from standard omelettes at lower levels to monster meat recipes that require you to straight up slay dragons, drag their meat back to the restaurant, and cook it up, bringing a whole new meaning to &amp;ldquo;farm-to-table&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, this game mixes a fairly light-hearted (and obscenely cleverly written) storyline with extremely nerve-hitting and far-reaching themes like grieving a lost parent, the meaning of family and belonging, and what it means to choose your own path in Life, be it with the title-case L in the context of the game or in reference to self-determination in life in general. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly easily moved by media, but somehow this cute little game that lets you don a wok as a hat while you work in a restaurant with a cook named Alfredo and bonk monsters named things like &amp;ldquo;The Napdragon&amp;rdquo; upside the noggin with two princesses in tow somehow got to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, like&amp;hellip;look at this screenshot. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;adorable&lt;/em&gt;. You could argue that I should have saved my Dosh (yes, that is the actual name for this game&amp;rsquo;s currency) for better weapons or something, but I had twenty grand and bought a cute lil&amp;rsquo; log cabin with flowers and shit. It&amp;rsquo;s great. I invited my girlies over for tea and we&amp;rsquo;re gonna go out and go fishing in an active volcano later so I can catch some Lava Prawns and make this game&amp;rsquo;s equivalent of Cajun gumbo. Those are things you can do. You can also&amp;hellip;like, do the story, I guess, save the world or whatever, but the beauty of this game is that it makes a point to remind you that there&amp;rsquo;s always time for tea, and I love that about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;m enthralled with this game for the same reason that I decided to spend hours and devote server space to gushing about these records and obscure old games&amp;ndash; sometimes you want a break from penning inordinately personal horror narratives or illustrating extraordinarily deep historical tales and the best cure for all that heavy is to spend a few hours fucking off and grinding dinosaurs for culinary ingredients in a maid outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life needs balance, whether it&amp;rsquo;s spelled with a capital L or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-been-smoking&#34;&gt;WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN SMOKING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, pipe tobacco. Since I quit drinking this is the only vice I have left that I can be pretentious as all shit about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;you know, I say that, but I drank bottom shelf bourbon straight or with no-cal sodie and I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that my taste in smokes is a bit lacking. Anyways, while I&amp;rsquo;m not going to even imply that I&amp;rsquo;m a connoisseur by any means, here&amp;rsquo;s my favorite three tins of the past couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gurkha-retribution&#34;&gt;GURKHA RETRIBUTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectacular English blend. I got this in a tin sampler of the Gurkha line, and to be honest this is the only one that impressed me. Heavy on the Turkish Orientals and Latakia, the blend has a fantastic woody room note and has a sizable heft to its hit without being overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cascadia-pipe-co-vertical-limit&#34;&gt;CASCADIA PIPE CO. VERTICAL LIMIT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got this one in yet another sampler over the holidays, with an additional Cascadia tin, a pipe, and a cute lil&amp;rsquo; tin campin&amp;rsquo; mug and folding pocketknife.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Out of the two, Vertical Limit is the one I remember most&amp;ndash;nice and easy burning, heavy on the Burleys, and with a good amount of smoked Kentucky you can absolutely taste. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally go for these types of brick cuts&amp;ndash;they literally included the knife in the sampler because you need &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to cut these heavily pressed leaves with&amp;ndash;but if I decide to pick a brick again over my usual preferred flake cuts I&amp;rsquo;ll probably go with this&amp;rsquo;n. Probably. There&amp;rsquo;s still three other offerings from Cascadia I have yet to try out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4th-generation-1931&#34;&gt;4TH GENERATION 1931&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not gonna lie, this is my new go-to. The flake here feels just &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; to rub out onto your pipe-packing surface, the flavor is spot the fuck on and pairs gorgeously with my usual hefty method of preparing French press coffee the way I like&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and while this is mainly billed as a Burley blend you can absolutely taste and enjoy the Virginias in it and the subtle note of Cavendish just sends it into the stratosphere. I&amp;rsquo;ve already got more tins on order. With as much as is on my desk this year, Lord knows I&amp;rsquo;ll need it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A masterwork by one of the patron saints of detective fiction, and Call Of Duty 69: Ghost Goes to The Optometrist&#39;s Office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S NEXT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not going to lie, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time to read as of late. Is this a good thing? Probably, given the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m about to be doing a whole shitton of reading when I start in on re-working the script for BARREN in between a few other projects and Our Lady Maven Issue 2. I mentioned this a bit in the start of this document, but as you can probably tell from the &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/0003/1_02.png&#34;&gt;screenshot of my working file here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be drowning in a LOT of dry shit for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I&amp;rsquo;ve always got a couple dime-store numbers kicking around, and I&amp;rsquo;m always on the hunt for both quality reprints of noir classics and modern thriller fiction in paperback as well as more and more ridiculous pulp nonsense. I&amp;rsquo;ve had one of each flavor nestled nicely inside my purse for the past month, and while I haven&amp;rsquo;t left the house for a long enough time to get to sit down somewhere and read them, I&amp;rsquo;m very much looking forward to finishing both Chandler&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Little Sister&amp;rdquo; and whatever godforsaken nonsense &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OMEGA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That phrasing may sound like I&amp;rsquo;m hate-reading the latter, but seriously, I fuckin&amp;rsquo; love ridiculous bullshit like this. You&amp;rsquo;re talking to someone who will unironically argue that Escape From LA is better than Escape From New York if you get me drunk enough to be comfortable gushing about my passion for campy action flick dreck.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely looking forward to finding out whether or not &amp;ldquo;dollar-store Snake Pliskin brandishing a tacticool anti-materiel rifle with the stand still up and a fucking phoropter strapped to his face&amp;rdquo; is as ridiculous as whatever&amp;rsquo;s in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also got a hefty backlist as far as movies goes&amp;ndash;maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get to a few of &amp;lsquo;em next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all I got for now. I still have to do that write-up about Talkie Time, and while I hoped to be a bit more punctual with that one it&amp;rsquo;s looking like by the time I finish writing it I&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up tacking on our schedule for The Jazz Program for the month of March to the end of it. Months tend to go by fairly quickly when you&amp;rsquo;ve got ADHD, but February especially always seems to sneak up on me when I least expect it. Regardless, thanks as always for reading. You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, Astrud Gilberto was November&amp;rsquo;s pick and Frank Sinatra&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;suicide albums&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;namely, No One Cares, Only The Lonely, and Where Are You?&amp;ndash;were played in December. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing research for this post, I actually found out that Breathe Carolina hails from Denver&amp;hellip;which honestly kind of explains quite a bit as to why living in Denver sucked so much ass. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you gentrify Southern hip-hop but if anyone was going to do it it was gonna be some Denver kids. I also found out doing said research that one of the founding members &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thedailybeast.com/insufferable-twitter-stock-trading-influencers-who-boasted-of-making-millions-are-indicted&#34;&gt;has spent his past few years being obnoxious on social media and getting arrested for securities fraud&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;which, again, peak Denver. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never acknowledge Nocturniquet&amp;rsquo;s existence and you can&amp;rsquo;t make me. That album NEVER HAPPENED, I tell you, and that fact has NOTHING TO DO with the fact that said nonexistant album is a two out of ten at best. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were selling it for fifteen dollars because it &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t have a hard drive&amp;rdquo;. It was also an Xbox 360 Slim model, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; an external hard drive, a fact which I did not bother enlightening the clerk on. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know the buffalo-meat-serving nightclub in Snatcher is entirely different than the island-of-misfit-militiamen in MGSV or the severely-incompetently-staffed secret base in the MSX original. I also happen to know that Metal Gear Mk. II in MGS3 is a direct reference to the Metal Gear Mk. II player companion in Snatcher, right down to the chassis design, so maybe we should remind ourselves from time to time that &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/IDUShHRJ9aw?t=70&#34;&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re just some games and we should really just relax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:6&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;mma be real with you here, I mainly bought it for the knife. I never say no to free knives. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put about a quarter cup of dark roast expresso beans, an eigth of a stick of cinnamon, and a half teaspoon of chicory into a grinder. Bring your kettle to a boil, toss in the bean and spice mix, put just enough water in to let the mix bloom, stir once counter-clockwise, and let rest for two minutes. Once those flavors have time to get to know each other, do a very slow pour clockwise against the glass of the French press, then let sit for five minutes. Stir three times counter-clockwise to remove a bit of the bite, let sit for five, and press down. Boom&amp;ndash;an immaculate cup of heavy-duty brew. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:8&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, Escape From New York is the better made film and I know it. I just happen to adore campy action trash and to me Escape From L.A. is infinitely more fun. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame I don&amp;rsquo;t drink anymore. You&amp;rsquo;d get a much better explanation from Drunk Sarah. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0002/05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Datafruits&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; You might not like it, but this is what peak UI design looks like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. Since finally deleting &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/245/165/433.gif&#34;&gt;my Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of an issue. Usually, I&amp;rsquo;d use Twitter to let listeners know what we&amp;rsquo;d be playing that week, as well as make some dumb jokes and encourage folks to tune in. Since I took the thing out back and shot it, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to tune in, &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/chat&#34;&gt;head on over to datafruits.fm/chat&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&amp;rsquo;re broadcasting this week&amp;hellip;well, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-jazz-program-and-what-does-it-do&#34;&gt;What Is A Jazz Program, And What Does It Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligatory &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/rG6ZgXSMDX4?t=79&#34;&gt;Homestar Runner references aside&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Sarah Allen Reed And The Jazz Program&amp;rdquo; is exactly what it says on the tin&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse for me (Sarah Allen Reed) to share my love of jazz with all of you fine folks for two hours every Tuesday night. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a love affair with jazz for the majority of my life, and unlike most of my long-term relationships this one has yet to end in a gigantic ball of flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most folks with raging, life-altering addictions, I started young. I was raised in various places outside of Saint Louis, MO (a town so attached to jazz that our hockey team is called the Saint Louis Blues) and when I was growing up, I had a choice between two radio stations I was allowed to listen to in the very Christian household I was raised in. One was Joy FM, an absolute garbage fire of a contemporary Christian radio station that eventually &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timesnewspapers.com/webster-kirkwoodtimes/features/joy-fm-ready-to-make-transition-to-kfuo-fm-classic-99-airwaves/article_c9776bb8-516d-506e-9d0f-9adc3357b32f.html&#34;&gt;bought out and unceremoniously destroyed one of the only independent classical music stations in the contiguous United States&lt;/a&gt;. (I&amp;rsquo;m still mad about that, for the record.) The other was that exact classical music station, which (thanks to some fantastic individuals and an outpouring of community support) &lt;a href=&#34;https://classic1073.org/&#34;&gt;currently exists on the top of the dial in the form of Classic 107.3&lt;/a&gt;. Given the fact that contemporary Christian music is one of exactly two genres of &amp;ldquo;music&amp;rdquo; I consider to be unlistenable (the other being modern country, and both for roughly the same reasons)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. you can take a guess as to which of the two options I picked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://news.stlpublicradio.org/arts/2015-11-22/obituary-don-wolff-prominent-defense-attorney-known-for-sharing-his-love-of-jazz&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0002/01.png&#34; alt=&#34;The man himself.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The man himself. RIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Granted, if my very religious foster parents were so insistent upon keeping me on the straight and narrow, they prooobably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have let me listen to that one either&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Broadway Spotlight&amp;rdquo; was also a weekly fixture on Classic 99, and given the fact that I ate that up every Saturday evening I&amp;rsquo;m honestly shocked that anyone was surprised when I finally came out of the closet.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up for exactly one program&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.stlpublicradio.org/arts/2012-10-02/im-don-wolff-and-i-love-jazz&#34;&gt;I Love Jazz by the late and incomparable Don Wolff.&lt;/a&gt; was aired every Friday night, and I tuned in religiously. If there is one reason why I fell in love with the power of radio, it is Classic 99, and Don is 95% of that for me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many highlights in my god-awful childhood, but hearing the sentence “I’m Don Wolff, and I love jazz!” and drowning myself in one of the most majestic forms of music known to man was one of the few. To this day, if there&amp;rsquo;s one form of sonic expression that I hold near and dear to my heart more than any, it&amp;rsquo;s jazz, and The Jazz Program is my tribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Check this blog week when I write a bit about it, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/shows/the-jazz-program-with-sarah-allen-reed-780922f3-7de0-445e-83bb-6a5188316668&#34;&gt;just tune in!&lt;/a&gt; Until then, let me talk about what we&amp;rsquo;re playing this month and who we&amp;rsquo;re spotlighting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;february-2023-jazz-program-schedule&#34;&gt;February 2023 Jazz Program Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;https://www.discogs.com/artist/257623-Houston-Person&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0002/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Houston Person&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Houston Person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-31-2023---houston-person&#34;&gt;January 31, 2023 - Houston Person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-a-sentimental-mood-the-nearness-of-you-and-my-romance&#34;&gt;In A Sentimental Mood, The Nearness Of You, and My Romance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day yet? No, because if it was we&amp;rsquo;d be playing J. Dilla. (See below.) No, tonight we&amp;rsquo;re playing three classic albums from soul saxophonist Houston Person, all three of which are guaranteed to get you in a romantic state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got two selections from his time at High Note Records-1998&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/721084-Houston-Person-My-Romance&#34;&gt;My Romance&lt;/a&gt; and 2000&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/release/5607748-Houston-Person-In-A-Sentimental-Mood&#34;&gt;In A Sentimental Mood&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;re closing the evening out with a much funkier record from 1978, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/805191-Houston-Person-The-Nearness-Of-You&#34;&gt;The Nearness Of You&lt;/a&gt;, released on Muse Records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-7-2023---django-reinhardt--stéphane-grappelli&#34;&gt;February 7: 2023 - Django Reinhardt &amp;amp; Stéphane Grappelli&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rome-1949&#34;&gt;Rome, 1949&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been privy to the absolute magic that is Django Reinhardt, here&amp;rsquo;s a great place to start. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/release/14329170-Django-Reinhardt-St%C3%A9phane-Grappelli-Rome-1949&#34;&gt;Rome, 1949&lt;/a&gt; is a three-disk set featuring violinist Stéphane Grappelli paired up with the master guitarist over the span of three disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinhardt&amp;rsquo;s time in Italy after returning from his time in the States in the late 1940s has a lot of fascinating details that paint a wonderful picture of the man himself&amp;ndash;according to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/django-reinhardt/author/delaunay-charles/&#34;&gt;biography by Charles Delaunay&lt;/a&gt; the guitar master would sometimes show up for scheduled concerts without a guitar or amplifier, or even refuse to show at all, skipping the shows to &amp;ldquo;walk to the beach&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;smell the dew&amp;rdquo;. While you can definitely hear that free spirit in these recordings, we thankfully did in fact get them at all, and they&amp;rsquo;ve been compiled here in this fantastic three-disk set from Label Ouest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-14-2023---_valentines-day-booty-bumpin-special_---j-dilla&#34;&gt;February 14, 2023 - &lt;em&gt;Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day Booty Bumpin&amp;rsquo; Special!&lt;/em&gt; - J. Dilla&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;donuts-beats-2002-12-and-ruff-draft-beats&#34;&gt;Donuts, Beats 2002 1&amp;amp;2, and Ruff Draft Beats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see some of you thinking J. Dilla is a weird choice for a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day Special. If you&amp;rsquo;re on that list, remind me to check on your boyfriend and/or girlfriend, as they&amp;rsquo;ve clearly never gotten to experience a decent ending to a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day date in their life. I feel like someone owes it to them to fix that, and if it ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna be you &lt;em&gt;somebody&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; gotta step up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Dilla is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; face of the Detroit sound of instrumental production as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, and you can&amp;rsquo;t get better instrumentals to dance, romance, and take off your pants to. We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Donuts, Beats 1&amp;amp;2, and Ruff Draft Beats in their entirety, and we&amp;rsquo;re gonna go long into the night. Light some candles, put down the good blanket, and pour some good liquor. We aren&amp;rsquo;t playing love songs this Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day. We&amp;rsquo;re playing &lt;em&gt;lovemaking music, baby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-21-2023---horii-katsumi-project&#34;&gt;February 21, 2023 - Horii Katsumi Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hot-is-cool-sky-cruisin-and-ocean-drive&#34;&gt;Hot Is Cool, Sky Cruisin&amp;rsquo;, and Ocean Drive&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it getting warm yet? No? Well, fuck. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for warm beach weather for the past five months, and while it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna get here any sooner, we can at least play some classic Japanese jazz fusion while we wait for the landlord to fix the hot water heater. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be playing the quintessential 1987 release &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/1393045-Katsumi-Horii-Project-%E5%A0%80%E4%BA%95%E5%8B%9D%E7%BE%8EProject-Hot-Is-Cool&#34;&gt;Hot Is Cool&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 1997&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/2109667-Horii-Katsumi-Project-Sky-Cruisin&#34;&gt;Sky Cruisin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; and 1988&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/1266264-Katsumi-Horii-Project-Ocean-Drive&#34;&gt;Ocean Drive&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which features immaculate cover art by master Japanese illustrator &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.eizin.co.jp/&#34;&gt;Eizin Suzuki&lt;/a&gt;. Look at that painting and tell me you don&amp;rsquo;t wish it was summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-28-2023---crime-jazz-night&#34;&gt;February 28, 2023 - CRIME JAZZ NIGHT!&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; CRIME JAZZ CRIME JAZZ CRIME JAZZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz&amp;ndash;both the moniker denoting the weird hodge-podge of genres from lounge to exotica that acompanied the numerous neo-noir and police drama epics that haunted cinemas in the &amp;rsquo;60s and &amp;rsquo;70s, and the now-defunct &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecrimelounge2.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;series of compilation records hosted on Blogspot and lost due to the demise of Rapidshare.&lt;/a&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re talking about the latter in this case. Being a relentless archivist, I have been hunting for far, far too long for copies of this series, and at long last I have nearly the entire second &amp;ldquo;season&amp;rdquo; (as they called it) of releases in my posession. Until I run out, we&amp;rsquo;ll be playing these fantastic records in their entirety on the last Tuesday of every month. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve only tracked down the second season&amp;ndash;if you have the first, email me at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;sarah@sarahallenreed.com&lt;/a&gt; and send me some download links and I will personally buy you a beer (or coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s our schedule for this month. Thanks in advance for tuning in; hope you enjoy the show. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon with a bit of information about Talkie Time, as well as our schedule for the month of February.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thanks as always for reading; you&amp;rsquo;re amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not.

      <title>#001: A Fresh Start, Old Computers, and a New Coat Of Paint</title>
      <link>/post/0001/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, y&amp;rsquo;all. As you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&amp;hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off updating my website for over a year and some change now. 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly my year, and even if I had the energy to do it then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been so unreasonably busy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the time. But now I&amp;rsquo;ve got more than enough time, and so in the interest of ensuring that I&amp;rsquo;m not constrained to the character limit of Twitter or the weird &amp;ldquo;photo not posted!&amp;rdquo; behavior that Instagram gets every single time I write a caption that contains phrases like &amp;ldquo;trans rights&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;nazis have no place in modern society&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;fuck&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do what a lot of other artists are doing and go back to longer-form writing here &lt;em&gt;ye olde web 1.0 style&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to think of an opening salvo, either. Seeing as I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily plunking away on this computer terminal working on this codebase for half a month, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better (or more stereotypically trans) topic to start with than my perpetual aesthetic obsession with my Linux desktop and open-source software, especially in an industry that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly known for going open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hardware&#34;&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Screenshot of the website in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a good portion of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux for the vast majority of my creative career. Given the fact that I do professional illustration, audio work, and creative work in general for a living, that&amp;rsquo;s not what you&amp;rsquo;d call a &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; choice. Linux has a bad rap for being what most creative professionals would refer to as &amp;ldquo;functionally unusable&amp;rdquo; (and for good reason, especially in the professional audio space). I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in free and open source software since I was a teenager, however, and at this point I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine using anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few reasons I use free, libre, and open-source software (or FLOSS, for short) in nearly every applicable scenario I can (and tend towards using abandonware and old software when I can&amp;rsquo;t)&amp;ndash;it aligns with a good percentage of my principles and way of being in the world, I appreciate the freedom to cusomize and tinker, I can&amp;rsquo;t stand rent-seeking behavior in corporations that like to clamp down monopolies on certain industries (especially creative fields), etc., etc., ad infinitum. With that stated, there is a fairly importing contributing factor as for why I got into Linux in the first place: I&amp;rsquo;m poor as all get out, and always have been. Linux is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for me it has one thing that has always set it above the rest&amp;ndash;free as in freedom. I got into Linux back in the days when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford a computer that can run anything else. The vast majority of my early career saw me too poor to afford anything even remotely close to cutting edge, and so I just grabbed whatever computer I could find, slapped Linux on it, and made the little bastard do what I needed it to do. And to this day, I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily doing the same thing with all my computers ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup3.png&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; My current IDE, vscodium (a telemetry-free, open source fork of Visual Studio Code). Also shown is the equivalent of my &#34;start menu&#34;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davatorium/rofi&#34;&gt;rofi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in history, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to get your hands on a relatively usable thin-client (like the Lenovo Thinkcentre M93p I&amp;rsquo;m using here) and it&amp;rsquo;s also easier than ever to customize whichever distro you&amp;rsquo;re using to get it to behave exactly how you want, or just to pick and download a free and open-source distribution of Linux tailor-made to audio production or graphics and bonk it over the head to function however you want. With companies like Adobe having a reputation for needlessly screwing over their customers at any given opportunity and other companies that were, at one point, &amp;ldquo;better about that&amp;rdquo; going much the same way, there&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fewer better times to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use a stock distribution. Never really have. What you&amp;rsquo;re seeing here is a borderline &lt;a href=&#34;https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn&#34;&gt;/r/unixporn&lt;/a&gt;-ready power user workstation, beaten into the ground and painted in a nice patina of trans- and femboy-pride colors. (Just like this website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://variant-archive.tumblr.com/post/179097473122/femboy-pride-flag&#34;&gt;if you didn&amp;rsquo;t catch the intentional color scheme choices&lt;/a&gt;.) That&amp;rsquo;s not a purely stylistic choice (although I do have a fondness for the artistic merit of a finely tuned-workstation) as much as it is force of habit. For the longest time, all I had to work with and create work with were 10-15 year old laptops, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to get a crotchety old crank like a IBM T60 humming again, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that can do the job quite like a minimalistic desktop environment and using nothing but command-line apps for every task you can squeeze into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode&#34;&gt;urxvt&lt;/a&gt; window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do much of that sort of thing anymore (although I do keep my old Thinkpads very close to my heart, &lt;a href=&#34;/resume/bio&#34;&gt;as you can see in my author photo in the &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; page on this website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;that lil&amp;rsquo; guy there is my beloved Thinkpad X60, Conseil.) and can use the full range of what modern open-source software has to offer to my advantage. I currently run two different computers for 90% of my production; a Lenovo Thinkpad P90 (named after my beloved Piranese mix, Polyhymnia) that sits just above my drawing board that I use for listening to radio shows, podcasts, and Let&amp;rsquo;s Plays while I work on inks (and which hooks directly down into my oversized scanner and an ancient screenless Wacom tablet in case I need to do digital touch-up or color work on whichever piece I&amp;rsquo;m working on) and this little old guy here, Herotodus (named after the ancient Greek historian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup4.png&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The ol&#39; battlestation. Herotodus (the computer) sitting on Goliath (the secretary desk), ready for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it involves me having to do some writing in any form, be it research for a new book, bullet journalling, hacking away on the website or other development projects, working with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&#34;&gt;index card catalogue that I use in lieu of a functioning memory&lt;/a&gt;, or even reading a bit, Herodotus and Goliath (the secretary desk she sits on) is the dynamic duo I turn to. I&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to do quite a bit with Winetricks to get some of my favorite classic games running, so you can often catch me in the mornings in the studio playing a hand of Cribbage or Spades or running through some old text adventure games as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client&#34;&gt;thin client&lt;/a&gt; is that you can fit the little guys damn near anywhere&amp;ndash;in a drawer, wedged between some books, mounted underneath the desk, or really anywhere you can think of that you can pipe some cords out of. I can&amp;rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m a strict observer of the teachings of the Church of Cable Management, but I am someone who believes in doing the equivalent of &amp;ldquo;going on Christmas and Easter to see Grampa and take a family photo in the name of keeping up appearances&amp;rdquo;. Some rubber bands, a bit of &amp;ldquo;shove the cables in back of stuff&amp;rdquo; and the old &amp;ldquo;wrap the cords around the monitor&amp;rdquo; trick are more than enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herotodus is hooked into an old-school 4:5 aspect ratio monitor I snagged from an old job I worked at. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s neurodiverse impulse, writer&amp;rsquo;s habit &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeremyutley.design/blog/the-daily-discipline&#34;&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&amp;rsquo;s old &amp;ldquo;yellow legal pads&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, or just plain old aesthetics, but I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to function with anything involving getting words or code down if I&amp;rsquo;m not typing it out on a clicky keyboard and seeing it displayed on a 4:3 or similar aspect ratio monitor. 16:9 doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it for me, for some reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fair share of CRTs as well over the years&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re just easier on the eyes, at least for me&amp;ndash;but not only will one not fit on top of Goliath at any viewable angle but the only one I have currently seems to have burnt out. (Quite frankly, I&amp;rsquo;d use my ancient Brother WP-3550 as a daily driver if I could&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for when I inevitably get around to spending a post opining about my typewriter and word processor collection.) This ancient HP 1755 does its job though, and I do love its side-mounted USB ports for transferring files and what-not, as well as its sturdiness. The old girl&amp;rsquo;s built like a tank. I&amp;rsquo;ve always admired that in a lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-desktop&#34;&gt;The Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  My favorite Monday morning pasttime, Sierra Online&#39;s &#34;Hoyle Card Games 2005&#34;, running through &lt;a href=&#34;https://winehq.org&#34;&gt;Wine.&lt;/a&gt; Yes, you can have your table partner be a giant grizzly bear. Yes, he talks. His name is Harley. No, I&#39;m not happy about this hand either.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as software goes, I use a plethora of open-source software in my daily workflow. The entire system itself is a weird frankenstein monster of piping &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Airblader/i3&#34;&gt;i3gaps&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xfce.org/&#34;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://feeblenerd.blogspot.com/2015/11/pretty-i3-with-xfce.html&#34;&gt;The Feeble Nerd&amp;rsquo;s post on the subject&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know how to set that up&amp;ndash;with a good amount of UI/UX customizations as well. Me being the absolute fruit I am (and also prone to headaches when confronted with any color emanating from a screen writ large that isn&amp;rsquo;t a variation upon a theme of black or grey), I&amp;rsquo;ve customized almost the entire thing in the pinkest and purplest colors I can find and installed a bunch of plugins and custom themes to ensure I never have to deal with &amp;ldquo;light-mode&amp;rdquo; anything if I can avoid it. At some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably clean up and upload my config files to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; so anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested can clone them and customize them to their liking; if that happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll link it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical software, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gimp.org&#34;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; for graphics editing and tinkering with larger UI elements, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vscodium.com/&#34;&gt;VS Codium&lt;/a&gt; with a Vim emulation plugin for programming and other code manangement work (although &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/&#34;&gt;I used Atom until the crooks bought out Github and sunsetted the poor thing&lt;/a&gt;; RIP to the best IDE I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used), &lt;a href=&#34;https://novelwriter.io/&#34;&gt;novelwriter&lt;/a&gt; for long-form document editing and planning (i.e. graphic novels, games, and other things that require keeping track of characters, settings, and concepts) &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghostwriter.kde.org/&#34;&gt;ghostwriter&lt;/a&gt; for shorter-form Markdown pieces (like this blog here!) and a few other odds and ends here and there for other workflow-related things. I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.winehq.org/&#34;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dosbox.com/&#34;&gt;DosBox&lt;/a&gt; to emulate old PC games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mednafen.github.io/&#34;&gt;Mednafen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carpeludum.com/kega-fusion/&#34;&gt;Kega-Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, and a couple other emulators for console games, and I do play a fair amount of Linux games as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/&#34;&gt;PySolFC&lt;/a&gt; is a perennial favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re moving studios (and states!) in a few months here, and while I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to carting an entire secretary desk and an army of computers, typewriters, and sundry halfway across the country for the umpteenth time, I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly imagine studio life without them. (Plus, I need the typewriters to give you folks half the lettering that shows up in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourladymaven.com/&#34;&gt;Our Lady Maven!&lt;/a&gt; It just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same if I used a font&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how often I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating this blog, but seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have Twitter anymore (which means I don&amp;rsquo;t have many other outlets to talk about games, books, and records I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by in the studio), I can&amp;rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you I&amp;rsquo;m completely invested in keeping Instagram around, and after years of having to use social media as a professional in this industry I&amp;rsquo;ve been burnt out to all hell on the entire concept, this is more or less going to be what I use to keep y&amp;rsquo;all updated.
A large part of my struggle over the past couple years has been balancing the need for a &amp;ldquo;professional freelance illustrator branding&amp;rdquo; with the part of me that genuinely loves and wants to talk about creative pursuits, weird inspirations, and the troubles, tribulations, and triumphs of life that inspire a lot of my work in an honest and genuine manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a lot of different thoughts on how to tackle that problem, but this is probably gonna be how I do that, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try and update it at least a couple times a month to let y&amp;rsquo;all know what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, what I&amp;rsquo;ve been enraptured in, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You definitely don&amp;rsquo;t have to read every single post on here if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to, but hopefully this will be a nice little window into the life and thought process of the giant dork who pens and voices what (I&amp;rsquo;d hope) are some of your favorite comics, books, and radio shows. If you want to get ahold of me to ask some questions about whatever it is I wrote about, request a topic for me to write a bit about (ask me about bits of my artistic process, for instance) or just send me a letter, you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com/resume/bio&#34;&gt;my current mailing and email address over on the About Me page on my portfolio site.&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do a lil&amp;rsquo; letter column if I get enough mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;SARAH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah. I&amp;rsquo;m an underground cartoonist, professional illustrator, and wandering ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling stories and creating work for what is basically my entire adult life, and this is where I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to place my thoughts on doing so, as well as ramblings about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAu2X4BExfk&#34;&gt;life in general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is mainly where I write about things that hold my interest, and is also where I put notes on books, records, and other such things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I&amp;rsquo;d shy away of viewing this as an extention of my professional work as an illustrator&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider it out of the question to view this as a suppliment to my work as a storyteller. I do illustration and contract work to pay the bills, sure, but the vast majority of my ouvure is decidedly more introspective, and you could view this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/&#34;&gt;digital garden&lt;/a&gt; as one would view &lt;a href=&#34;https://emvi.com/blog/luhmanns-zettelkasten-a-productivity-tool-that-works-like-your-brain-N9Gd2G4aPv&#34;&gt;Luhmann&amp;rsquo;s zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-notebook-of-william-blake&#34;&gt;William Blake&amp;rsquo;s sketchbooks&lt;/a&gt;, albeit written by an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incongruous&#34;&gt;incongurious&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dolt&#34;&gt;dolt&lt;/a&gt; rather than a man of letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll see posts about where I&amp;rsquo;ll be and what I&amp;rsquo;ll be up to, if those happen to be things you can tune into or come say hi to me at. The most frequent of those posts are the &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/the-jazz-program/&#34;&gt;schedules&lt;/a&gt; to my weekly three-hour radio block on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt;, but in the few instances that see me doing interviews or showing up in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meatspace&#34;&gt;meatspace&lt;/a&gt; they&amp;rsquo;ll be on here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also curate a &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/photo-roll/&#34;&gt;photo roll&lt;/a&gt; with things in my world I find important. I am not a fan of social media for a good many reasons, but &lt;a href=&#34;/post/0005&#34;&gt;having my Instagram account nearly banned for reasons I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand&lt;/a&gt; has kind of taught me the lesson that, if I care about the few memories I bother to share with the world, I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hostin&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;em on the walled garden. You can also see &lt;a href=&#34;/post/photoroll00/&#34;&gt;drawings and photos of me on here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to do that for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I keep a &lt;a href=&#34;/post/links/&#34;&gt;list of links&lt;/a&gt; on here of sites by folks I respect, folks whose work I enjoy, or folks I consider friends. I adamantly refuse to link to social media if I can at all avoid it, so all of the links listed are websites away from the confines of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/silo&#34;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt; and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be consider a comprehensive list of &amp;ldquo;good folks&amp;rdquo; due to the fact that not everyone has their own website. If we&amp;rsquo;re buds and you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, consider making a website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer all your questions, feel free to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;/post/faq&#34;&gt;(in)frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt;, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed/resume/bio&#34;&gt;the slightly more professional-sounding bio on my portfolio website&lt;/a&gt;, or just &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;drop me an email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com/resume/bio/&#34;&gt;write me a letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that the nonsense I prattle on about is not a reflection of those who employ me or enlist my services, but because bad faith is the rule on the modern Internet I&amp;rsquo;m putting that disclaimer here. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do keep a zettlekasten of my own in a cigar box, and at some point&amp;ndash;probably when I start putting pieces of my next book together&amp;ndash;intend on porting it to Tiddlywiki and posting it here, in case folks wish to follow the proverbial bouncing ball. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This FAQ page is a constant work in progress, as is most of the site. As I get new questions, think of things I might want to make sure my readers know, and invent new answers and/or questions for those answers, I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding them here. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find an answer to whatever it is that you&amp;rsquo;re curious about, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt; and I might just add it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back soon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-damn-fine-cup-of-truck-stop-coffee-a-bit-about-this-blog&#34;&gt;A Damn Fine Cup Of Truck Stop Coffee (A Bit About This Blog)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-make-a-blog&#34;&gt;Why make a blog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase the Allman Brothers Band, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68X8o0S7vJc&#34;&gt;I was born a&amp;rsquo;ramblin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I have a lot to say that doesn&amp;rsquo;t neatly fit into the thematic bonds of my books, paintings, or records. I also know full well through experience that I&amp;rsquo;m at perpetual risk of watching things I say disappear off the Internet if I don&amp;rsquo;t self-host it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reasons for that, and a good portion of those reasons have to do with the walled garden nature of the Internet these days. To put it bluntly, I check a lot of boxes that the Silicon Valley kids make a habit of shadowbanning and de-platforming, the three biggest ones being &amp;ldquo;visibly trans&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;vocally anarchist&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;says &amp;lsquo;fuck&amp;rsquo; a lot&amp;rdquo;. Besides, a lot of what I have to say isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;advertiser friendly&amp;rdquo;, doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit neatly into 240 characters, or isn&amp;rsquo;t something I want to leave to the mercy of the algorithm to begin with. Hell, the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m visibly queer is in and of itself an argument against having social media at all. Twitter specifically isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly kind to girls like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a huge proponent of the free and open web/&lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;indie web&lt;/a&gt; movements, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my life hacking around on Linux systems. It seemed a reasonable jump to just make a lil&amp;rsquo; website to put it all on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-isnt-your-blog-on-your-main-website-anymore&#34;&gt;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t your blog on your main website anymore?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swear too much and that&amp;rsquo;s my professional portfolio site. That&amp;rsquo;s about 99% of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to talk about things that aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about my work. While I am of the school of thought that holds that the things an artist surrounds themselves with, the places they have been and are planning on going&amp;ndash;the things that shape their way of being in the world&amp;ndash;define their oeuvre, I&amp;rsquo;m fully aware that isn&amp;rsquo;t a common outlook, especially among folks that would be reviewing my portfolio for professional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I wanted a clear line of demarcation drawn between &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what is functionally my resume&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s me&amp;rdquo;, and putting it on a separate website with a name I&amp;rsquo;ve never used for any other project was the easiest way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-all-the-footnotes&#34;&gt;Why all the footnotes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have gotten a LOT of complaints from human editors and grammar-check software alike that my sentences are too wordy and that I go off in too many directions. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of times where I want to add tangents to things I&amp;rsquo;m saying, but when I do an editing pass a few days later I take a look at it and realize it adds nothing to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say, or that it adds something but in an inefficient way. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that turning those passages into footnotes still keeps the color of the addendum without breaking up the flow of the thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes I just wanna make sure you all have context that you might otherwise miss. I make a lot of random in-jokes and dated references in regular conversations because I&amp;rsquo;m just one of those types of nerds. (I mean, hell, the titles of these sections are a Homestar Runner reference, a Neil Gaiman short story, and a line from Twin Peaks, respectively.) I also read way too much, and I happen to enjoy dropping random slang, colloquialisms, and antiquated phrasings that I find fun into my ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, those random references and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ten-dollar_word&#34;&gt;ten-dollar words&lt;/a&gt; are just kind of part of my literary voice at this point. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to neuter that part of myself for the sake of readability, but I also want folks to know what that archaic word I just used meant or what that reference was to. Sometimes I just put a link to a dictionary entry, Youtube video, or Wikipedia article directly in place, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just use a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-up-with-the-domain-name&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up with the domain name?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it a tad bit more poetically than is probably needed here, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any more succinct way to describe the core of my being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drink a LOT of coffee. As in, an unreasonable amount. Being American and self-employed by most definitions of the word, I don&amp;rsquo;t have health insurance. And, like most professional artists, I have fairly severe ADHD (among other things that put me squarely in the realm of &amp;ldquo;neurodiverse&amp;rdquo;.) Coffee and pipe tobacco are more or less how I self-medicate, and they&amp;rsquo;re both habits that kind of define me&amp;ndash;you very rarely see me without a cup of coffee and either a briar or corncob pipe or my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vapeyaya.com/Premium-E-cig-E-Pipe&#34;&gt;weird pipe/e-cigarette hybrid&lt;/a&gt; that I use to get around no-smoking regs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/faq/03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/faq/3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;dale cooper just &lt;i&gt;gets&lt;/i&gt; me, maaaaaan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thats-not-entirely-unique-though-a-lot-of-artists-are-obnoxiously-loud-about-their-coffee-drinking-problems-why-not-lattecoffee-or-something&#34;&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not entirely unique, though; a lot of artists are obnoxiously loud about their coffee drinking problems. Why not &amp;ldquo;latte.coffee&amp;rdquo; or something?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to put it simply, I&amp;rsquo;m working class. I used to be a trucker, and when I haven&amp;rsquo;t been a trucker I&amp;rsquo;ve been either nomadic or generally poor. I also spent a lot of my life in and around America&amp;rsquo;s highway systems in general, including in the I-70 corridor in rural Missouri where most of my accent comes from. I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a Starbucks whose coffee I enjoy (including during my brief stint as a barista) but I have a fairly sizable collection of Flying J, Pilot, Love&amp;rsquo;s, Casey&amp;rsquo;s, and other branded travel mugs from truck stops and fuel stations I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in my travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, truckstop.coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also, &amp;ldquo;damnfine.coffee&amp;rdquo; was taken. No Twin Peaks reference for me, unfortunately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-work-is-usually-somewhere-between-relatively-straightforward-and-deadly-serious-whats-with-the-tone-in-this-blog&#34;&gt;Your work is usually somewhere between &amp;ldquo;relatively straightforward&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;deadly serious&amp;rdquo;. What&amp;rsquo;s with the tone in this blog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work&amp;rsquo;s as serious in its tone as it is because I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pretty rough life. The vast majority of my personal/solo work is my way of working through the types of difficult emotions and portraying the beauty and pain I&amp;rsquo;ve seen during a life&amp;rsquo;s worth of loss and traumatic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated&amp;hellip;wearin&amp;rsquo; nothin&amp;rsquo; but a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/hair-shirt&#34;&gt;hair shirt&lt;/a&gt; is no way to dress, man. And this blog is (mostly) about how I approach my life through my art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, if you&amp;rsquo;ve missed my foolishness in my work entirely, you&amp;rsquo;re not looking hard enough. You&amp;rsquo;re talking to someone that back-ended a relatively serious neo-classical live recording &lt;a href=&#34;https://shibito.bandcamp.com/track/sound-check-bonus-track&#34;&gt;with a sample from the sound check where I tell the sound booth guy I&amp;rsquo;m planning on playing nothing but Rhianna and then scatted my way through a Bee Gees track.&lt;/a&gt;. I regularly open my &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm/djs/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;weekly block on datafruits.fm&lt;/a&gt; with samples from old TV shows, Youtube meme mashups &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmHHjN5FJEo&#34;&gt;(my favorite being this one)&lt;/a&gt; and random other nonsense back to back with whatever random tracks I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a human being, I&amp;rsquo;m not known for being serious. Excitable, sure. Overly analytic, absolutely. Obsessive at times, definitely. Do I get far too deep into techniques and theme analysis on here? Darned tootin&amp;rsquo;. But this website is for me as a human being to talk about my life, my interests, my process, and my way of being in the world, as well as how all of that comes together to influence the final output. A large part of that mix involves me being a goofball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re expecting nothing but the academic wankery, obscene amounts of gravitas, tightly wound symbolism and narratives, and dry-as-nails studiousness that frames a lot of my other work, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;m going to disappoint you here. This is me writing about my life, and in real life I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a goober. Expect some color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-cartoonist-errant-is-that-like-a-knight-errant&#34;&gt;What is a &amp;ldquo;cartoonist-errant&amp;rdquo;? Is that like a knight-errant?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;er·rant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;adjective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;formal/humorous. erring or straying from the proper course or standards.&lt;br&gt;
eg., &amp;ldquo;he could never forgive his daughter&amp;rsquo;s errant ways&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;archaic/literary. traveling in search of adventure.&lt;br&gt;
eg., &amp;ldquo;that same lady errant&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;Oxford Languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suffix itself I stole from my sister, Autumn Redacted, who describes herself as a &amp;ldquo;bioethicist-errant&amp;rdquo;. It fits me quite well, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly known for doing anything the right way. Or, to put it more accurately, I&amp;rsquo;m most known for explicitly going out of my way to do things the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; way on purpose as a joke, or to intentionally figure out how to do things in the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; way in order to create a unique result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also not exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d call a typical professional in this field. I got kicked out of high school instead of going to college for art, and spent a lot of my early adulthood getting into some manner of trouble. Most of my &amp;ldquo;career&amp;rdquo; experience is in either culinary or some variation of logistics work instead of marketing or communications, and I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly known for my subtlety or camera-friendliness in a career currently monopolized by &amp;ldquo;personal brands&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also spent a good portion of my adult life trying to find new and interesting ways to solve whatever issues the pieces I&amp;rsquo;m working on are facing. Most of my career output doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit neatly into any major category as a direct result, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of my career in places you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to find someone with my profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason the bottom of this page displays the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/&#34;&gt;glider&lt;/a&gt;; I have more in common with hacker culture than I do with most other folks in my field. If there&amp;rsquo;s a way to break something, I&amp;rsquo;ll find it just to see how it ticks. And if there&amp;rsquo;s something interesting to be found in the dissection process, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that I used to refer to myself as a &amp;ldquo;professional jackass&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;a moniker which works ever so slightly better if the reader knows to use the &amp;ldquo;playful, chaotic prankster&amp;rdquo; definition of &amp;ldquo;jackass&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackass_(franchise)&#34;&gt;popularized by the television show of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. Issue is, most folks don&amp;rsquo;t, and you could argue that Johnny Knoxville and crew didn&amp;rsquo;t either. So, cartoonist-errant it is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alright-well-whats-with-the-rest-of-the-tagline-why-foolishness&#34;&gt;Alright, well, what&amp;rsquo;s with the rest of the tagline? Why &amp;ldquo;foolishness&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My foster grandfather was a fairly big influence on who I grew up to be. He had a farm in rural Missouri on the topmost part of the Ozarks, and that came with it all of the colloquialisms one would expect it to. (Those colloquialisms and his particular accent is the reason I have roughly half of mine, as well, but that&amp;rsquo;s another topic.) &amp;ldquo;Quit yer foolishness&amp;rdquo; was his way of angrily telling me to quit fuckin&amp;rsquo; around and being a goofball when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprising literally no one, I have never quit either my foolishness or my rambling. Hence, the tagline, as well as my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/raison%20d%27%C3%AAtre&#34;&gt;raison d&#39;être&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-sarah-and-what-does-she-do-about-me&#34;&gt;What Is A Sarah, And What Does She Do? (About Me)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that &lt;a href=&#34;/post/about&#34;&gt;you can view my &amp;quot;About Me&amp;quot; page here&lt;/a&gt; for most of the answers one would have to the question &amp;quot;Who is Sarah?&amp;quot;. For the rest, here&amp;rsquo;s this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-are-you-exactly&#34;&gt;Who are you, exactly?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah, and I&amp;rsquo;m a cartoonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in illustration for most of my adult life and been making scribbles of some variety for the vast majority of my life before that. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been a trucker, a chef, a programmer, a janitor, a radio DJ, a touring musician, and a bunch of other things at some point or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I&amp;rsquo;m just a storyteller with a penchant for exaggeration and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fish%20story&#34;&gt;fish-stories&lt;/a&gt;. Hence why I call myself a cartoonist as opposed to anything else&amp;ndash;even when I&amp;rsquo;m not drawing, I&amp;rsquo;m telling big stories and painting pictures with words and sound. Hell, given my mannerisms, I&amp;rsquo;m basically a cartoon character myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-old-are-you&#34;&gt;How old are you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, didn&amp;rsquo;t your mother tell you not to ask a lady questions like that? I know I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a lady, but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/faq/02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/faq/2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; why y&#39;all damn kids askin me this foolishness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-you-look-like&#34;&gt;What do you look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idiot, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for a serious answer to that one&amp;hellip;I go out of my way these days to try and make sure there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many photos of me online&amp;ndash;half because I&amp;rsquo;m visibly trans and work in media, and half because I just usually don&amp;rsquo;t like how I look and don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to my work. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason why blind auditions have become the standard in symphonic music&amp;ndash;there&amp;rsquo;s often very little correlation between an artist&amp;rsquo;s output and their physical form, and you can know me and my way of being better through my work than you ever can through the pound of flesh I inhabit in meatspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I know a lot of people seem to want to see the face behind the pen, so &lt;a href=&#34;/post/photoroll00&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a little gallery of self-portraits and press photos if you absolutely need an answer to that particular burning question.&lt;/a&gt; The little self-portrait doodle on the banner is fairly accurate, as well. I&amp;rsquo;m rarely seen without coffee, my pipe, and my headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-can-i-see-your-artcheck-out-your-musiclisten-to-you-on-the-radio&#34;&gt;Where can I see your art/check out your music/listen to you on the radio?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of links, lists, and illustration samples &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;over here on my main website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-tuned-into-your-radio-show-love-your-voice-but-whats-up-with-your-accent&#34;&gt;I tuned into your radio show. Love your voice, but what&amp;rsquo;s up with your accent?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve often joked that my accent is half Saint Louis hood and half Ozark backwoods. This is mostly correct&amp;ndash;I hail from a mix of the rougher parts of both of those places, and there&amp;rsquo;s also a bit of Mainer thrown in from my time on the East coast, as well as some other bastardizations&amp;ndash;but the reason it&amp;rsquo;s so thick comes down to one factor; isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about accents is that they&amp;rsquo;re mostly shorthand for whatever language you happen to be speaking. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time travelling alone, and when you talk to yourself like a crazy person as much as I do, you tend to talk to yourself exclusively in that shorthand, and if you already &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; an accent it tends to make it worse. Hence why it&amp;rsquo;s a bit thicker and a bit more wonky than a lot of other Missourians. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time practicing my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stenography&#34;&gt;steno&lt;/a&gt;, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-you-supposed-to-be-exactlyare-you-a-boy-or-a-girlwhats-going-on-with-the-whole-gender-thing-you-got-goin-on-there&#34;&gt;What are you supposed to be, exactly/Are you a boy or a girl/What&amp;rsquo;s going on with the whole gender thing you got goin&amp;rsquo; on there?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s the easiest answer, in the immortal words of the Muppets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;caption floatcenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/faq/02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/faq/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;I&#39;m an ARTIST&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; my gender is &amp;quot;gay muppet&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use she/her (and no other set of) pronouns, feminine nouns in languages with gendered nouns, and I identify wih neither womanhood nor as a man. I also do not consider being &amp;ldquo;nonbinary&amp;rdquo; to apply to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like a more thorough explanation, expand the following section. Fair warning: the following is about as blunt and hostile to this question as my answer to it would be in real life should it come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary style=&#34;color:#b288dd;&#34;&gt;If you&#39;re the type to ask trans folks invasive questions and absolutely insist upon needing a more thorough explanation, click here.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely blunt, I view demanding any further explanation/justification of one&amp;rsquo;s identity aside from &amp;ldquo;which pronouns should i refer to you by&amp;rdquo; as needlessly invasive and utterly irrelevant in 99% of usecases. If I don&amp;rsquo;t know you and you need to refer to me in a written work, or if you wish to mention me in passing conversation, the common pronoun of &amp;ldquo;she/her/hers&amp;rdquo; should be all you need. Anything else is just &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)#LGBT_identities&#34;&gt;othering&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of posturing curiosity. My tone here for answering this question further sounds annoyed because I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; annoyed at having to answer further, almost as much as I would be if you asked me if I&amp;rsquo;ve had &amp;ldquo;the surgery&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a personal question and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know the answer past what I&amp;rsquo;ve already given you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that stated, I have had further answers demanded of me a lot more than I&amp;rsquo;d like, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also had far more folks&amp;ndash;including editors, promoters, and other people in the industry who should know better&amp;ndash;simply assume I&amp;rsquo;m something I&amp;rsquo;m not without bothering to ask me how I wish to be referred to. I also know a non-zero amount of folks clicked this FAQ for no other reason than to find a more &amp;ldquo;accurate&amp;rdquo; answer to this question for whatever reason. So, in the interest of dodging these questions at parties and at panels for the rest of my life, here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cliff_notes&#34;&gt;cliff notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To underscore, &lt;strong&gt;I use she/her pronouns and use feminine nouns in languages which have gendered nouns.&lt;/strong&gt; I do not go by they/them, he/him, or whatever other pronouns you think I should be using. If you use anything other than she/her and you have reason to know better than to do so, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you&amp;rsquo;re intentionally misgendering me and I have no interest in interacting with people who would rather prescribe me an identity than listen to what I have to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insofar as descriptive adjectives go, your best bet is some variation of &amp;ldquo;femme&amp;rdquo; if you feel the need to refer to me/describe me using that part of speech for whatever reason. With that stated, &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;female&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, nor do I have any connection to whatever those words mean. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This statement does not make me a &amp;ldquo;man&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;in fact, if you call me a &amp;ldquo;man&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;male&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meatspace&#34;&gt;meatspace&lt;/a&gt; there&amp;rsquo;s pretty solid odds that you&amp;rsquo;re going to get slapped. I just have no connection to society&amp;rsquo;s definition of &amp;ldquo;womanhood&amp;rdquo;, and I find the insistence upon a binary choice utterly useless. I often refer to myself as a &amp;ldquo;femme&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;femboy&amp;rdquo;, and those two phrases and their close variations are the closest to a descriptor of my presentation that you&amp;rsquo;re going to get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite what some might call evidence to the contrary, &lt;em&gt;I am not non-binary.&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t find any definition of the term in current common parlance useful, and I have never heard anyone use it to describe me that wasn&amp;rsquo;t simply going out of their way to ignore how I have requested to be addressed for the sake of their own convenience. Don&amp;rsquo;t use it to describe me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past those three bullet points and the set of pronouns given, my gender presentation or identity is neither a conversation I enjoy having nor something I think should be a topic of conversation with random strangers, be them online or in real life. Yes, this includes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;~~~~
&lt;p&gt;While a lot of my work is explicitly queer in content and nature, the specifics of said queerness isn&amp;rsquo;t something I care to go into detail unless I have to in order to tell the specific story I&amp;rsquo;m telling. Thing is, 99% of the time neither my gender presentation nor my sexual preferences are particularly relevant for those stories&amp;ndash;including the stories I have to tell here&amp;ndash;and I don&amp;rsquo;t view it as useful for the audience to know&amp;ndash;or care&amp;ndash;what I am. &amp;ldquo;She/her&amp;rdquo; should give you all the information you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-think-youre-cute-what-does-that-make-me-im-having-a-crisis-here&#34;&gt;I think you&amp;rsquo;re cute. What does that make me? I&amp;rsquo;m having a crisis here!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes you gay, bud. Congratulations. No, your gender presentation doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. You&amp;rsquo;re just gay now and you&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to live with that. Mazel tov. Your card is in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna send me some snail mail, you can do that as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com/resume/bio&#34;&gt;My current mailing addy is on my website.&lt;/a&gt; No pipe bombs or arsenic, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t. If you send me hate mail, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably block you. You aren&amp;rsquo;t making it into the mailbag in a &amp;ldquo;dunking-on&amp;rdquo; section, and I probably won&amp;rsquo;t even read it at all the second I&amp;rsquo;ve read enough to catch on to your lack of good faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As good as I am at writing insults, I didn&amp;rsquo;t delete my Twitter account just to give that kind of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=soykaf&#34;&gt;soykaf&lt;/a&gt; a soapbox via a different medium. If you wanna say weird, ignorant shit about how angry you are at me for whatever reason, do it into your pillow.&lt;/p&gt;

I also don&amp;rsquo;t know what boundaries are. Where can I put my thoughts about that?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do that into your pillow too, buddy. Just keep it out of my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

Can I message you about your experiences/ask you for advice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m not the best person to ask about that. I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://old.reddit.com/r/ask_transgender/comments/7kcgnq/what_does_it_mean_to_be_called_an_egg/drd9uxv/?context=3&#34;&gt;unintentionally cracked quite a few eggs&lt;/a&gt; in my time, sure, but to be quite frank I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the best time trying to play mother hen. The vast majority of my experiences as a trans femme have been overwhelmingly negative, both socially and medically, and if you come to me for advice I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have much life experience that isn&amp;rsquo;t going to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to tell you that you &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; transition&amp;ndash;hell, I&amp;rsquo;d be dead if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t. I will, however, warn you that, if you ask me for advice, I won&amp;rsquo;t exactly have any warm-and-fuzzies to give you. Add into that the fact that my autistic ass is a bit more blunt than it needs to be in the most mundane of conversations, and you have a recipe for disaster. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of wonderful folks in the trans community that are more than happy to assist newly hatched eggs in coming into their own, and if you need a &amp;ldquo;mother hen&amp;rdquo; figure there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of girls in the community for you to look to. Sadly, as much as as I wish I was, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that I&amp;rsquo;m not the best person for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best I can tell you is that however you feel is more than likely worth exploring, and that, for whatever it&amp;rsquo;s worth, I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you for having the courage to confront it and work out those feelings and emotions for yourself. It takes a lot of courage to tackle these types of core questions about one&amp;rsquo;s identity, and that courage is worth something. You&amp;rsquo;re worth something too, and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up. If you have any more questions, or just want to say hi, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. I might just add them to the list here, or I&amp;rsquo;ll answer &amp;lsquo;em in a mailbag post at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; me answering mailbag questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, thanks for spending some time with me today. Stay safe out there, folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&#34;floatright&#34; src=&#34;/construction.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following are links to websites of folks I think are cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this page to promote social media networks, and the vast majority of folks (specifically, other cartoonists/DJs) I know have social media accounts in place of a website, so this list shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be considered an exhaustive compendium of folks I think are neat. If you&amp;rsquo;re not on this list but think you should be, I probably can&amp;rsquo;t find your website or I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to adding you yet because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with other obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a website, make one then &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;email me a link to it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This list is VERY incomplete at the moment&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of a bunch of things and need time to track down a bunch of my friends&amp;rsquo; websites. I&amp;rsquo;m tossing it up as-is at this moment, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding to it fairly constantly. Check back soon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh is more or less the closest I have to one single person I can credit/blame with setting me on this line of work. Hell, he literally gave me my first dip pen when I was a kid, and his style of writing and cartooning continue to both influence my own and blow my mind today. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joshuawcotter.com/&#34;&gt;Check out his work here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, a lot of folks seem to be fascinated with knowing what folks who create things look like. I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood it&amp;ndash;partially because I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly the type of artist known for going out of her way to look remotely presentable&amp;ndash;but for those of you curious, here&amp;rsquo;s a tiny little selection of self-portraits and press photos I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

  &lt;p&gt; Self-portrait from the pages of Tabula Rosetta. Drawn in...2018, I think? Might have been late 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/02.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; One example of my yearly tradition of in-joke self-portraits. This one&#39;s got me ripping on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mincingmockingbird.com/products/fatal-american-need-postcards-set-of-12-troubled-birds&#34;&gt;Matt Adrian&#39;s Troubled Birds.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/03.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; An old promotional poster for my yearly charity drive on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datafruits.fm&#34;&gt;Datafruits&lt;/a&gt;, Jazzy Fuckin&#39; Holidays. This one was in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/04.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Another in-joke yearly selfie. This one&#39;s ripping on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images&#34;&gt;René Magritte&#39;s &#34;The Treachary Of Images&#34;. 2021.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/05.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Another dumb in-joke selfie, this time last year&#39;s. This one&#39;s me as &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gentlemen&#34;&gt;Spy from TF2 in the old &#34;Gentlemen&#34; meme.&lt;/a&gt; 2022&#39;s entry into the series.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/06.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/06.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; My current profile pic on most websites I&#39;m on, as well as my icon on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com&#34;&gt;main website&lt;/a&gt;. 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/07.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/07.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; A small selfie taken in mid-2022. One of the only decent photos of me in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--
&lt;div class=&#34;floatcenter caption&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/photo/000/08.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/photo/000/08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The most recent photo taken of me without me breaking the camera in protest. Fall 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
