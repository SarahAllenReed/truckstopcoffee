  <p> You might not like it, but this is what peak UI design looks like. </p>
</div>
<p>Hey y&rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on <a href="https://datafruits.fm">datafruits.fm</a> for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. Since finally deleting <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/245/165/433.gif">my Twitter account</a>, however, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of an issue. Usually, I&rsquo;d use Twitter to let listeners know what we&rsquo;d be playing that week, as well as make some dumb jokes and encourage folks to tune in. Since I took the thing out back and shot it, however, I&rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to tune in, <a href="https://datafruits.fm/chat">head on over to datafruits.fm/chat</a> on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&rsquo;re broadcasting this week&hellip;well, read on.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-jazz-program-and-what-does-it-do">What Is A Jazz Program, And What Does It Do?</h2>
<p>Obligatory <a href="https://youtu.be/rG6ZgXSMDX4?t=79">Homestar Runner references aside</a>, &ldquo;Sarah Allen Reed And The Jazz Program&rdquo; is exactly what it says on the tin&ndash;it&rsquo;s an excuse for me (Sarah Allen Reed) to share my love of jazz with all of you fine folks for two hours every Tuesday night. I&rsquo;ve had a love affair with jazz for the majority of my life, and unlike most of my long-term relationships this one has yet to end in a gigantic ball of flame.</p>
<p>Like most folks with raging, life-altering addictions, I started young. I was raised in various places outside of Saint Louis, MO (a town so attached to jazz that our hockey team is called the Saint Louis Blues) and when I was growing up, I had a choice between two radio stations I was allowed to listen to in the very Christian household I was raised in. One was Joy FM, an absolute garbage fire of a contemporary Christian radio station that eventually <a href="https://www.timesnewspapers.com/webster-kirkwoodtimes/features/joy-fm-ready-to-make-transition-to-kfuo-fm-classic-99-airwaves/article_c9776bb8-516d-506e-9d0f-9adc3357b32f.html">bought out and unceremoniously destroyed one of the only independent classical music stations in the contiguous United States</a>. (I&rsquo;m still mad about that, for the record.) The other was that exact classical music station, which (thanks to some fantastic individuals and an outpouring of community support) <a href="https://classic1073.org/">currently exists on the top of the dial in the form of Classic 107.3</a>. Given the fact that contemporary Christian music is one of exactly two genres of &ldquo;music&rdquo; I consider to be unlistenable (the other being modern country, and both for roughly the same reasons)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. you can take a guess as to which of the two options I picked.</p>
<div class="floatleft caption"">
  <p><a href= "https://news.stlpublicradio.org/arts/2015-11-22/obituary-don-wolff-prominent-defense-attorney-known-for-sharing-his-love-of-jazz"><img src="/blog/0002/01.png" alt="The man himself."></a></p>
  <p> The man himself. RIP. </p>
</div>
<p><em>(Granted, if my very religious foster parents were so insistent upon keeping me on the straight and narrow, they prooobably shouldn&rsquo;t have let me listen to that one either&ndash;&ldquo;Broadway Spotlight&rdquo; was also a weekly fixture on Classic 99, and given the fact that I ate that up every Saturday evening I&rsquo;m honestly shocked that anyone was surprised when I finally came out of the closet.)</em></p>
<p>I bring this up for exactly one program&ndash;<a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/arts/2012-10-02/im-don-wolff-and-i-love-jazz">I Love Jazz by the late and incomparable Don Wolff.</a> was aired every Friday night, and I tuned in religiously. If there is one reason why I fell in love with the power of radio, it is Classic 99, and Don is 95% of that for me. I didn&rsquo;t have many highlights in my god-awful childhood, but hearing the sentence “I’m Don Wolff, and I love jazz!” and drowning myself in one of the most majestic forms of music known to man was one of the few. To this day, if there&rsquo;s one form of sonic expression that I hold near and dear to my heart more than any, it&rsquo;s jazz, and The Jazz Program is my tribute to it.</p>

Check this blog week when I write a bit about it, or <a href="https://datafruits.fm/shows/the-jazz-program-with-sarah-allen-reed-780922f3-7de0-445e-83bb-6a5188316668">just tune in!</a> Until then, let me talk about what we&rsquo;re playing this month and who we&rsquo;re spotlighting:</p>

<div class="floatright caption"">
  <p><a href= "https://www.discogs.com/artist/257623-Houston-Person"><img src="/blog/0002/02.png" alt="Houston Person"></a></p>
  <p> Houston Person. </p>

<h4 id="in-a-sentimental-mood-the-nearness-of-you-and-my-romance">In A Sentimental Mood, The Nearness Of You, and My Romance</h4>
<p>Is it Valentine&rsquo;s Day yet? No, because if it was we&rsquo;d be playing J. Dilla. (See below.) No, tonight we&rsquo;re playing three classic albums from soul saxophonist Houston Person, all three of which are guaranteed to get you in a romantic state of mind.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got two selections from his time at High Note Records-1998&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/721084-Houston-Person-My-Romance">My Romance</a> and 2000&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/5607748-Houston-Person-In-A-Sentimental-Mood">In A Sentimental Mood</a>, and we&rsquo;re closing the evening out with a much funkier record from 1978, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/805191-Houston-Person-The-Nearness-Of-You">The Nearness Of You</a>, released on Muse Records.</p>
<h3 id="february-7-2023---django-reinhardt--stéphane-grappelli">February 7: 2023 - Django Reinhardt &amp; Stéphane Grappelli</h3>
<h4 id="rome-1949">Rome, 1949</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never been privy to the absolute magic that is Django Reinhardt, here&rsquo;s a great place to start. <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/14329170-Django-Reinhardt-St%C3%A9phane-Grappelli-Rome-1949">Rome, 1949</a> is a three-disk set featuring violinist Stéphane Grappelli paired up with the master guitarist over the span of three disks.</p>
<p>Reinhardt&rsquo;s time in Italy after returning from his time in the States in the late 1940s has a lot of fascinating details that paint a wonderful picture of the man himself&ndash;according to his <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/django-reinhardt/author/delaunay-charles/">biography by Charles Delaunay</a> the guitar master would sometimes show up for scheduled concerts without a guitar or amplifier, or even refuse to show at all, skipping the shows to &ldquo;walk to the beach&rdquo; or &ldquo;smell the dew&rdquo;. While you can definitely hear that free spirit in these recordings, we thankfully did in fact get them at all, and they&rsquo;ve been compiled here in this fantastic three-disk set from Label Ouest.</p>
<h3 id="february-14-2023---_valentines-day-booty-bumpin-special_---j-dilla">February 14, 2023 - <em>Valentine&rsquo;s Day Booty Bumpin&rsquo; Special!</em> - J. Dilla</h3>
<h4 id="donuts-beats-2002-12-and-ruff-draft-beats">Donuts, Beats 2002 1&amp;2, and Ruff Draft Beats</h4>
<p>I can see some of you thinking J. Dilla is a weird choice for a Valentine&rsquo;s Day Special. If you&rsquo;re on that list, remind me to check on your boyfriend and/or girlfriend, as they&rsquo;ve clearly never gotten to experience a decent ending to a Valentine&rsquo;s Day date in their life. I feel like someone owes it to them to fix that, and if it ain&rsquo;t gonna be you <em>somebody&rsquo;s</em> gotta step up.</p>
<div class="floatleft caption"">

  <p> Cover art for "Ocean Drive", by <a href="http://gallery.eizin.co.jp/">Eizin Suzuki.</a></p>
</div>
<p>J. Dilla is <em>the</em> face of the Detroit sound of instrumental production as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, and you can&rsquo;t get better instrumentals to dance, romance, and take off your pants to. We&rsquo;ll be playing Donuts, Beats 1&amp;2, and Ruff Draft Beats in their entirety, and we&rsquo;re gonna go long into the night. Light some candles, put down the good blanket, and pour some good liquor. We aren&rsquo;t playing love songs this Valentine&rsquo;s day. We&rsquo;re playing <em>lovemaking music, baby.</em></p>
<h3 id="february-21-2023---horii-katsumi-project">February 21, 2023 - Horii Katsumi Project</h3>
<h4 id="hot-is-cool-sky-cruisin-and-ocean-drive">Hot Is Cool, Sky Cruisin&rsquo;, and Ocean Drive</h4>
<p>Is it getting warm yet? No? Well, fuck. We&rsquo;ve all been waiting for warm beach weather for the past five months, and while it&rsquo;s not gonna get here any sooner, we can at least play some classic Japanese jazz fusion while we wait for the landlord to fix the hot water heater. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be playing the quintessential 1987 release <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/1393045-Katsumi-Horii-Project-%E5%A0%80%E4%BA%95%E5%8B%9D%E7%BE%8EProject-Hot-Is-Cool">Hot Is Cool</a>, as well as 1997&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/2109667-Horii-Katsumi-Project-Sky-Cruisin">Sky Cruisin&rsquo;</a> and 1988&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/1266264-Katsumi-Horii-Project-Ocean-Drive">Ocean Drive</a>, the latter of which features immaculate cover art by master Japanese illustrator <a href="http://gallery.eizin.co.jp/">Eizin Suzuki</a>. Look at that painting and tell me you don&rsquo;t wish it was summer.</p>

</div>
<p>Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz&ndash;both the moniker denoting the weird hodge-podge of genres from lounge to exotica that acompanied the numerous neo-noir and police drama epics that haunted cinemas in the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, and the now-defunct <a href="http://thecrimelounge2.blogspot.com/">series of compilation records hosted on Blogspot and lost due to the demise of Rapidshare.</a> We&rsquo;re talking about the latter in this case. Being a relentless archivist, I have been hunting for far, far too long for copies of this series, and at long last I have nearly the entire second &ldquo;season&rdquo; (as they called it) of releases in my posession. Until I run out, we&rsquo;ll be playing these fantastic records in their entirety on the last Tuesday of every month. So far, I&rsquo;ve only tracked down the second season&ndash;if you have the first, email me at <a href="mailto:sarah@sarahallenreed.com">sarah@sarahallenreed.com</a> and send me some download links and I will personally buy you a beer (or coffee).</p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;s our schedule for this month. Thanks in advance for tuning in; hope you enjoy the show. I&rsquo;ll be back soon with a bit of information about Talkie Time, as well as our schedule for the month of February.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Thanks as always for reading; you&rsquo;re amazing and don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&rsquo;re not.
