  <p>FUCK YOU IT'S THE JAZZ PROGRAM!</p>
</div>
<p>Hey y&rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on <a href="https://datafruits.fm">datafruits.fm</a> for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records. This one will be our programming calendar for the month of January of 2024.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to tune in, <a href="https://datafruits.fm/chat">head on over to datafruits.fm/chat</a> on Tuesday evenings from 10 PM EST/7 PM PST to 1 AM EST/10 PM PST. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the show and read about the fantastic artists and old-time radio shows we&rsquo;re broadcasting this week&hellip;well, read on.</p>

  <p>IN THIS EPISODE, OUR BRAVE HERO STUBBORNLY RESISTS MAKING <em>EVEN ONE JOKE</em> ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AMERICAN POLITICS DESPITE BEING THREATENED BY A <em>LITERAL CLOWN WITH A GUN!</em></p>
</div>

<p><a href="/post/0020/#talkie-time-presents-the-holiday-shit-list--casey-crime-photographer---santa-claus-of-bum-boulevard--the-snowball">I promised you all a full episode of our beloved Casey last month</a>, and we&rsquo;re starting the new year with me paying out on that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got two episodes of everyone&rsquo;s favorite flash-toting, trenchcoat-wearing, raging-alcoholic somehow-hasn&rsquo;t-been-arrested-for-being-a-weirdo-in-public-yet nutjob named Casey for you tonight, and despite what the names of these episodes would imply they don&rsquo;t see our boy having that great of a night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting out with &ldquo;The Loaded Dice&rdquo;, which originally aired on September 4, 1947 and sees our boy Casey&rsquo;s professional gambler bud Steve getting framed for murder over some kind of misunderstanding involving such inconsequential details like &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a dead body in Steve&rsquo;s apartment and the stiff owed Steve money&rdquo;. Y&rsquo;know, stuff like that. Happens every day. Nothing to see.</p>
<p>Next up, we&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;The Tobacco Pouch&rdquo;, which aired two weeks later on September 18, 1947. Ann Williams wants to go do some shopping, and Casey has a run-in with a kleptomaniac and then gets straight-up abducted just to get out of boyfriend-pack-mule duties.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I love this particular radio program so much, it&rsquo;s because of dumb shit like this. Don&rsquo;t just take my word for it, though&ndash;come tune in and hear the magnificent dumb shit Casey gets up to for yourself.</p>

  <p>Look, I know I've conditioned you all to expect shitposts here, and I know this looks like I'm doing a <a href="https://paperback-paradise.com/">Paperback Paradise</a>-esque shop job here. But no. No, this is the actual cover art. I'm not even fucking with you guys this time-- <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/3100354-Al-Martino-Think-Ill-Go-Somewhere-And-Cry-Myself-To-Sleep">seriously, here's the Discogs page.</a> There's nothing I can do to make this any funnier.</a></p>
</div>
<p>2023 is dead and in the books, and it&rsquo;s time to dust ourselves off and prepare to stagger through yet another trip around the sun, and then another and another until Gojira comes back from the depths to mete out upon our wreched cities the kind of decimation and god-wrath which our insolent existence truly deserves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d introduce tonight&rsquo;s lineup with something along the lines of &ldquo;to celebrate&rdquo; or &ldquo;to commemorate&rdquo; or whatever here, but let&rsquo;s be honest, we&rsquo;re all still hung over. Hell, I&rsquo;m a year sober now, and <em>I&rsquo;m</em> hung over from the bullshit that was 2016 Part Eight. So no loud noises and no boisterous bullshit tonight; just cool, goofy crooners singing cool, sad songs with their goofy faces until I pass out at midnight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting it out with a record I&rsquo;ve been talking about a lot lately; Sonny James&rsquo; 1964 sad-country-crooner masterstroke, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re The Only World I Know&rdquo;. Next up, we&rsquo;ve got a bit of a perk-up, with Dino&rsquo;s 1971 record &ldquo;For The Good Times&rdquo;, and then Perkins here brings us right back down with his 1958 RCA release of &ldquo;On A Rainy Afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, finally, we&rsquo;ve got Al Martino in the corner making &ldquo;guess-who-farted&rdquo; faces about how I&rsquo;ve spent most nights ever since CERN <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cern-portal-to-another-dimension">turned on the Large Hadron Collider, sent us into the Bad Timeline, and fucked us all over</a>. Weird as the cover may be, his 1966&rsquo;s &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll Go Somewhere And Cry Myself To Sleep&rdquo; will close us out for the evening. Come join us, and remember to chant your yearly <em>ph&rsquo;nglui mglw&rsquo;nafh Cthulhu R&rsquo;lyeh wgah&rsquo;nagl fhtagn</em> to help us bring in the new year. It may not keep Gojira at bay, but it&rsquo;ll at least calm Cthulhu&rsquo;s ass down and we gotta hedge our bets where we can.</p>

  <p>If you enjoy the last program on tonight's show, by the way, and you want to dive deep into H.Q. Masur's oevure, <a href="http://killercoversoftheweek.blogspot.com/2009/04/bury-me-deep-by-harold-q-masur.html">J. Kingston Pierce's &quot;Killer Covers&quot;</a> has a great write-up on the man's work, with some great starting points to dive in at.</p>
</div>
<p>Hosted by Robert Author and David Kogan &ndash;best known for creating the Mysterious Traveler, which&hellip;.<em><strong>oh buddy, that&rsquo;s a series we&rsquo;ll get to eventually</strong></em>&ndash;Murder By Experts has one of the more interesting formats old-time radio.</p>
<p>Like many formats from other shows of the time period, Murder By Experts starts with an appeal to authority. But rather than getting J. Edgar Hoover&rsquo;s blessing to crack open case files (This Is Your FBI) or by paying some cash to down-and-out newspaper folk in exchange for dramatizing a story they broke (The Big Story), the Experts in Murder By Experts are <em>crime fiction writers</em>&ndash;&ldquo;experts of the &ldquo;&ldquo;art of murder&rdquo; itself. With that as the premise, you <em>know</em> you&rsquo;re in for some interesting joints.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got two for you tonight, starting out with John Dickson Carr introducing a selection by Bruno Fischer (who fans of the pulps may recognise as the author of The Ben Helm series and &ldquo;House Of Flesh&rdquo;, among other fantastic joints&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prescription For Murder&rdquo;, which originally aired on June 4, 1949.</p>
<p>Following that up, we&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Two Can Die As Cheaply As One&rdquo;, originally airing on April 17, 1950 and featuring Brett Halliday introducing a selection by Harold Q. Masur, which pulp fans may recognize as the creator of Scott Jordan, the lawyer-turned-investigator from books like &ldquo;Bury Me Deep&rdquo; (shown to the left here<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) and the 1962 short story compilation, &ldquo;The Name Is Jordan&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="the-jazz-program-pat-martino---interchange-1994--nightwings-1996-the-return-1987">The Jazz Program: Pat Martino - Interchange (1994) / Nightwings (1996)/ The Return (1987)</h3>

  <p>Let's face it--neither you nor I will never be as cool as Pat Martino. There are just some things we all will have to live with.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the most legendary guitarists to ever hold the instrument, the late Pat Martino should need no introduction. He entered the jazz scene in the late late 1960s with &ldquo;El Hombre&rdquo;, and proceeding to continuously knock in virtuosic performance after virtuosic performance until a bout with amnesia due to an aneurism in 1980 <a href="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/music/2014/05/pat_martino_discusses_relearni.html">knocked his memories out from under him</a>. That didn&rsquo;t stop him, though, and he re-taught himself guitar and kept delivering fantastic records one after the other until his final album &ldquo;Formidable&rdquo; on High Note Records in 2017. Martino&rsquo;s work is captivating, inventive, and&ndash;if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to play guitar at all&ndash;utterly mind-blowing. Sadly, Pat passed away in 2021, but his music still continues to blow the minds of jazz heads the world over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got three of his records from his time with the Muse label tonight, starting with his first performance back under his own group after relearning the guitar&ndash;and, it seems, re-discovering himself in the process&ndash;on 1987&rsquo;s masterpiece &ldquo;The Return&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll be following that up with 1994&rsquo;s &ldquo;Interchange&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;ll finish up the evening with 1996&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nightwings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it took every ounce of restraint in me to <em>not</em> include one of my favorite soul-jazz records here&ndash;Bobby Pierce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introducing Bobby Pierce&rdquo; from 1972 (or &ldquo;Piercing, as the Muse re-release is known), which features Pat on guitar. We&rsquo;ll get to Bobby&rsquo;s orange-covered classic another time, though, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

  <p>hey man it's a good office policy to have, alright</a></p>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest, I&rsquo;ve been playing an unholy amount of the Ace Attorney series as of late and I&rsquo;m blaming that for this week&rsquo;s episode. Thanks, Mister Edgeworth. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Mr. District Attorney&ndash;the radio play, not the 1941 Republic Pictures film of the same name, the 1941 Republic sequel to the 1941 Republic film called &ldquo;Mr. District Attorney In The Carter Case&rdquo;, the 1942 Republic sequel to THAT film called &ldquo;Secrets Of The Underground&rdquo;, OR the 1947 Columbia Pictures film <em>of the same name as the</em> <em><strong>first</strong></em> <em>film and the radio series</em> which is <em>entirely different in both tone and content</em> from the first film&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;look, maybe Mr. District Attorney and the Ace Attorney series have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney#Spin-offs">more in common than just subject matter</a>, alright?</p>
<p>Anyways, the radio play starred a good few actors in its title role, with Vicki Vola as Edith Miller and either Walter Kinsella or Len Doyle as Len Harrington, chief investigator for the District Attorney. Tonight&rsquo;s episodes have David Bryan and Len Doyle in the slots of our leading man and bumbling investigator, respectively.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Case Of The Living Dead Man&rdquo;, originally aired on July 26, 1953, and &ldquo;Case Of The Pyromaniac Murder&rdquo;, which originally aired on August 4, 1953.</p>

  <p>...no, i don't know why they named the album this either</p>
</div>
<p>You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a jazz fusion act out of Japan as legendary as Casiopea<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Issei Noro and Tetsuo Sakurai have been pumping out fantastic jazz fusion for longer than a good portion of my audience has been alive (including myself) and they&rsquo;re still going strong to this day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be focusing on the third iteration of Issei Noro and Tetsuo Sakurai&rsquo;s legendary jazz fusion act, Casiopea 3rd.</p>
<p>This lineup brings Kiyomi Otaka along for the keyboard section and puts the fantastic Akira Jimbo on the drumkit, and the grooves are as immaculate as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting the evening off with 2019&rsquo;s &ldquo;Panspermia&rdquo;, following it up with 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ta·Ma·Te·Box&rdquo;, and closing the evening out with 2016&rsquo;s &ldquo;I·Bu·Ki&rdquo;. Come join us.</p>

  <p>The coldest motherfucker to ever do it.</a></p>
</div>
<h3 id="talkie-time-the-black-museum---the-champagne-glass--the-claw-hammer">Talkie Time: The Black Museum - The Champagne Glass / The Claw Hammer</h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t step five feet into the history of old-time radio without running into the man himself, Orson Fucking Welles. An absolute juggernaut of the medium responsible for [most folks&rsquo; main cultural touchstone when it comes to the medium](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1938_radio_drama)</a> as well as an unreasonable amount of shows, one-offs, and careers, Welles is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>One of his later outings, The Black Museum originally aired starting in 1952, fourteen years after Welles and the Mercury Theater turned the world upside down with their infamous broadcast of The War Of The Worlds. With episodes based on true to life cases from Scotland Yard&rsquo;s murder files&ndash;the name &ldquo;The Black Museum&rdquo; was a moniker given in 1877 by a writer of The Observer to Scotland Yard&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Museum">Crime Museum</a>&ndash;this one shows our boy Welles at his absolute grisliest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Champagne Glass&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Claw Hammer&rdquo;, both of which were aired in the original run in 1952. (I could not find an original air date for either episode; or any of the other episodes in the series, for that matter.)</p>

  <p>Another absolute legend.</p>
</div>
<p>Tenor sax. Flute. Oboe. Bassoon. Bamboo flute. Koto. Shofar. Shanai. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/arts/music/yusef-lateef-innovative-jazz-saxophonist-and-flutist-dies-at-93.html">The man who &ldquo;played world music before world music had a name&rdquo;</a> played quite a few instruments in his seventy five year career, and you&rsquo;ll be hearing a damn good amount of them on the recording we&rsquo;ve got for you this evening.</p>
<p>Recorded directly from the boards at the Amphithéâtre de l&rsquo;Asiem in Paris on September 9, 1979, Yusef takes the sax, flute, and oboe to task as Khalid Moss (piano), Donald Pate (electric bass) and Martyn Barker (drums) back him up in this utterly insane live set. You won&rsquo;t want to miss this one.</p>

  <p>Not entirely relevant, but this cover art from the 1952 Ziff Davis-published oneshot is pretty nifty.</a></p>

<h3 id="talkie-time-presents-cloak-and-dagger-night-seeds-of-doubt--operation-sellout">Talkie Time Presents CLOAK AND DAGGER NIGHT: Seeds Of Doubt / Operation Sellout</h3>
<p>Based on Corey Ford and Alastair MacBain’s 1946 book “Cloak and Dagger: The Secret Story of the OSS”, Cloak and Dagger has proved a frequent listen while I’ve inked away at Our Lady Maven, and it’s absolutely worth a listen even for those of you who aren’t currently drowning yourself in WWII spy history for work.</p>
<p>While claiming to be based on fully authenticated case histories of OSS espionage, the series is about as wild as your average pulp from the era. Some language and themes haven’t exactly aged well (as with a lot of its ilk and similarly-themed shows from its era up until the 80s–see also half of James Bond’s catalogue) but if you can look past its flaws, it’s still an entertaining romp for those of us who love a good spy romp.</p>
<p>This is our fourth night in our listen-through of the full series, and we’ll be listening to the two episodes which sequentially followed last month’s edition–namely, “Seeds Of Doubt” and “Operation Sellout, which aired on September 1 and 8 respectively in 1950.</p>

  <p>got his mind on his money and his money from da CRIME (and/or composing for television and movies, y'know, whichever)</p>
</div>
<p>Those in the know, know about Crime Jazz. And if you don’t know, we’ll be getting you in the know tonight for yet another end-of-the-month installment of Crime Jazz Night.</p>
<p>We’ll be spinning the twelfth release in Volume 1, featuring two disks worth of the fantastic compositional work of the utterly legendary Tony Hatch&ndash;and when I say &ldquo;legendary&rdquo; I mean it.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/09/david-bowie-lower-third-bbc-verdict-documentary-the-first-five-years">performed with David Bowie</a>. He arranged, wrote, and produced for the likes of Chubby Checker, Benny Hill, and The Drifters. He composed the soundtrack for <em>The Champions</em>, <em>Love Story</em>, and <em>Airline</em>. And he ended up knighted as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Hatch is a living legend of film and television scores, and we&rsquo;ve got two disks worth of his life&rsquo;s work for you tonight.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s about it for this month! Thanks again for reading, and I genuinely hope you all tune in and join us. Next month is February, which&ndash;while it doesn&rsquo;t mark the first broadcast of The Jazz Program by a long shot&ndash;marks the first anniversary of me plotting out our programming in these writeups for all of you to enjoy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have anything planned for that (to be frank, I probably won&rsquo;t) but it is noteworthy. Hell, that programming lineup is half of why I started truckstop.coffee to begin with&ndash;if i remember correctly these writeups were what caused the original blog <a href="https://sarahallenreed.com">on my main website</a> to become so bloated that I had to move &lsquo;em to their own thing!</p>
<p>So either way, whether you&rsquo;ve been here from the jump or you&rsquo;re just now joining us, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here. Thanks for reading and indulging my hyperfocus on the music and the radio plays I love so much.</p>
<p>Stay safe, and I’ll see you all soon.</p>

<p>You might notice that, usually, I usually try to track down newspaper, magazine, or other advertisements for each show on here for these little images.

<p>As legendary as Noro and Sakurai&rsquo;s minty jam machine is, the distinction &ldquo;from Japan&rdquo; is necessary for two reasons&ndash;one, J-fusion is its own genre if we&rsquo;re being honest with ourselves, and two, The Rippingtons exist.
