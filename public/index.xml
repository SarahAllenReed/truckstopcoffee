      <description>What is this, exactly? While going through some old files on an old shared network drive trying to track down an old script I&amp;rsquo;m working on re-writing, I found this series of interview answers that I gave for a blog that wanted to interview me.
If that seems a strange way of doing things, it kind of is. It&amp;rsquo;s also more or less the norm on a lot of journalistic outlets nowadays, especially those that cater to small press books and records.</description>

      <description>Polyhymnia was supposed to be a service dog for my autism and PTSD, but the training she was supposed to get never actually happened. So now she&amp;rsquo;s just my favorite dumbass who tries her best. Here&amp;rsquo;s some cute photos of her over the years.

      <description>Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on datafruits.fm for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records.</description>

      <description>Quick note - as of me editing this post on March 15, my Instagram account has been reinstated. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to actively avoid using it unless necessary, as I stated in this post, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also added &amp;ldquo;Share To&amp;rdquo; buttons to these blog pages and to the galleries if you wish to show off my work to some folks or talk about what I have to say on this blog.</description>

      <description>The corkracks, sometime in the middle of production of Our Lady Maven.  Hey y’all! It’s your favorite dork, back at it again. I’ve just finished up the final touches on Issue 1 of Our Lady Maven at long last, and I’ve finally got time for a bit of a breather to write a bit about what I’ve been working on, what I’ve been reading when I have a second to sit down and read, what I’ve been listening to in the studio, what I’ve been playing in my wee small hours of the morning before I pass out for the day, and (for those few of you who are curious for reasons other than wondering “what the fuck is wrong with her”) what I’ve been smoking.</description>

Since finally deleting my Twitter account, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of an issue.</description>

      <description>Intro Hey, y&amp;rsquo;all. As you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&amp;hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.
So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah. I&amp;rsquo;m an underground cartoonist, professional illustrator, and wandering ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling stories and creating work for what is basically my entire adult life, and this is where I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to place my thoughts on doing so, as well as ramblings about life in general.
This blog is mainly where I write about things that hold my interest, and is also where I put notes on books, records, and other such things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.</description>

      <description>A Damn Fine Cup Of Truck Stop Coffee (A Bit About This Blog) Why make a blog? To paraphrase the Allman Brothers Band, I was born a&amp;rsquo;ramblin&amp;rsquo;. I have a lot to say that doesn&amp;rsquo;t neatly fit into the thematic bonds of my books, paintings, or records. I also know full well through experience that I&amp;rsquo;m at perpetual risk of watching things I say disappear off the Internet if I don&amp;rsquo;t self-host it.</description>

      <description>The following are links to websites of folks I think are cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this page to promote social media networks, and the vast majority of folks (specifically, other cartoonists/DJs) I know have social media accounts in place of a website, so this list shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be considered an exhaustive compendium of folks I think are neat. If you&amp;rsquo;re not on this list but think you should be, I probably can&amp;rsquo;t find your website or I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to adding you yet because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with other obligations.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, a lot of folks seem to be fascinated with knowing what folks who create things look like. I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood it&amp;ndash;partially because I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly the type of artist known for going out of her way to look remotely presentable&amp;ndash;but for those of you curious, here&amp;rsquo;s a tiny little selection of self-portraits and press photos I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken over the years.
