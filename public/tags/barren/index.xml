      <description>Hey ya&amp;rsquo;ll! As you know, it&amp;rsquo;s been a good minute since I&amp;rsquo;ve had the time to sit down and write a full-on Studio Update. We&amp;rsquo;re finally settled in&amp;ndash;mostly&amp;ndash;in the new studio1, and I wanted to check in and let y&amp;rsquo;all know what&amp;rsquo;s coming down the pike, what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, and where I&amp;rsquo;m planning on heading next.
 WHAT I&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN WORKING ON OUR LADY MAVEN 
Issue 2 on the drawing board.</description>

      <description>The following is a series of progress threads for pieces that are announced, that I have permission to share the creation process of, and that I want to share with you. These all used to be up solely on social media, but in the interest of both wanting to have everything in one place and insisting upon utilizing Indieweb principles to make sure my work isn&amp;rsquo;t lost to the ages for the umpteenth time thanks to the whim of some techno-jackanape, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting them here.</description>
