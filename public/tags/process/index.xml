      <description>Part one of two sets of progress photos of me working my way through the concept art for The Garden.
 
 The initial pencils for the concept art image. I hid [Gnome Chompski](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Garden_Gnome) in there somewhere--see if you can find &#39;im!  
 Starting in on inks, going section by section.  
 Layer layer layer  
 Most of the sections are filled in now; only a few more adjustments then it&#39;s digitization time.</description>

      <description>Some in-progress photos of me working my way through Our Lady Maven Issue 1.
 
 Inking panels from the comic.  
 Full art for Page 8.  
 Close up inks. You can see the ink smudges from the typewriter real well here.  
 Probably my favorite panel. 
 
 Sneaking in an overt homage to one of my favorite adventure game detectives</description>
