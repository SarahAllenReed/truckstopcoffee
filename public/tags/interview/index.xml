      <description>What is this, exactly? While going through some old files on an old shared network drive trying to track down an old script I&amp;rsquo;m working on re-writing, I found this series of interview answers that I gave for a blog that wanted to interview me.
If that seems a strange way of doing things, it kind of is. It&amp;rsquo;s also more or less the norm on a lot of journalistic outlets nowadays, especially those that cater to small press books and records.</description>
