      <description>IN A NOT TOO DISTANT HOLIDAY, NEXT THURSDAY AD!
 Hey y&amp;rsquo;all! As the vast majority of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been the host of The Jazz Program on datafruits.fm for a good couple years now, and the host of a small show called Talkie Time on the timeslot before it. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make a monthly post here to let you fine folks know which records we&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing each episode, as well as take a bit to talk about some of my favorite jazz and jazz-related artists and records.</description>

      <description>Part one of a series of progress photo galleries of me working through Our Lady Maven, Issue 2.
 Drafting, Pencilling, and Inking 
 Starting in on pencils. The lettering and all that was done (as always) on graph paper and glued up as I went; for a more in-depth look at how I do that, check out this process thread.  
 Here&#39;s the rest of the lettering, glued up and into place.</description>

 Initial pencils and lettering.  
 Starting in on inking.   
 First and second pass of inks down. I wanna point out here that the lil&#39; guy there in the witch&#39;s hand was designed by Datafruits&#39; own Zaxy. His name is Beamsprout, if you were curious.</description>
