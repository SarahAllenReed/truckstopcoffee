&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, y&amp;rsquo;all. As you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&amp;hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off updating my website for over a year and some change now. 2022 wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly my year, and even if I had the energy to do it then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been so unreasonably busy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the time. But now I&amp;rsquo;ve got more than enough time, and so in the interest of ensuring that I&amp;rsquo;m not constrained to the character limit of Twitter or the weird &amp;ldquo;photo not posted!&amp;rdquo; behavior that Instagram gets every single time I write a caption that contains phrases like &amp;ldquo;trans rights&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;nazis have no place in modern society&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;fuck&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do what a lot of other artists are doing and go back to longer-form writing here &lt;em&gt;ye olde web 1.0 style&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to think of an opening salvo, either. Seeing as I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily plunking away on this computer terminal working on this codebase for half a month, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better (or more stereotypically trans) topic to start with than my perpetual aesthetic obsession with my Linux desktop and open-source software, especially in an industry that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly known for going open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hardware&#34;&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Screenshot of the website in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a good portion of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux for the vast majority of my creative career. Given the fact that I do professional illustration, audio work, and creative work in general for a living, that&amp;rsquo;s not what you&amp;rsquo;d call a &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; choice. Linux has a bad rap for being what most creative professionals would refer to as &amp;ldquo;functionally unusable&amp;rdquo; (and for good reason, especially in the professional audio space). I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in free and open source software since I was a teenager, however, and at this point I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine using anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few reasons I use free, libre, and open-source software (or FLOSS, for short) in nearly every applicable scenario I can (and tend towards using abandonware and old software when I can&amp;rsquo;t)&amp;ndash;it aligns with a good percentage of my principles and way of being in the world, I appreciate the freedom to cusomize and tinker, I can&amp;rsquo;t stand rent-seeking behavior in corporations that like to clamp down monopolies on certain industries (especially creative fields), etc., etc., ad infinitum. With that stated, there is a fairly importing contributing factor as for why I got into Linux in the first place: I&amp;rsquo;m poor as all get out, and always have been. Linux is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for me it has one thing that has always set it above the rest&amp;ndash;free as in freedom. I got into Linux back in the days when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford a computer that can run anything else. The vast majority of my early career saw me too poor to afford anything even remotely close to cutting edge, and so I just grabbed whatever computer I could find, slapped Linux on it, and made the little bastard do what I needed it to do. And to this day, I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily doing the same thing with all my computers ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatright caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup3.png&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; My current IDE, vscodium (a telemetry-free, open source fork of Visual Studio Code). Also shown is the equivalent of my &#34;start menu&#34;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davatorium/rofi&#34;&gt;rofi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in history, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to get your hands on a relatively usable thin-client (like the Lenovo Thinkcentre M93p I&amp;rsquo;m using here) and it&amp;rsquo;s also easier than ever to customize whichever distro you&amp;rsquo;re using to get it to behave exactly how you want, or just to pick and download a free and open-source distribution of Linux tailor-made to audio production or graphics and bonk it over the head to function however you want. With companies like Adobe having a reputation for needlessly screwing over their customers at any given opportunity and other companies that were, at one point, &amp;ldquo;better about that&amp;rdquo; going much the same way, there&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fewer better times to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use a stock distribution. Never really have. What you&amp;rsquo;re seeing here is a borderline &lt;a href=&#34;https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn&#34;&gt;/r/unixporn&lt;/a&gt;-ready power user workstation, beaten into the ground and painted in a nice patina of trans- and femboy-pride colors. (Just like this website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://variant-archive.tumblr.com/post/179097473122/femboy-pride-flag&#34;&gt;if you didn&amp;rsquo;t catch the intentional color scheme choices&lt;/a&gt;.) That&amp;rsquo;s not a purely stylistic choice (although I do have a fondness for the artistic merit of a finely tuned-workstation) as much as it is force of habit. For the longest time, all I had to work with and create work with were 10-15 year old laptops, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to get a crotchety old crank like a IBM T60 humming again, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that can do the job quite like a minimalistic desktop environment and using nothing but command-line apps for every task you can squeeze into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rxvt-unicode&#34;&gt;urxvt&lt;/a&gt; window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do much of that sort of thing anymore (although I do keep my old Thinkpads very close to my heart, &lt;a href=&#34;/resume/bio&#34;&gt;as you can see in my author photo in the &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; page on this website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;that lil&amp;rsquo; guy there is my beloved Thinkpad X60, Conseil.) and can use the full range of what modern open-source software has to offer to my advantage. I currently run two different computers for 90% of my production; a Lenovo Thinkpad P90 (named after my beloved Piranese mix, Polyhymnia) that sits just above my drawing board that I use for listening to radio shows, podcasts, and Let&amp;rsquo;s Plays while I work on inks (and which hooks directly down into my oversized scanner and an ancient screenless Wacom tablet in case I need to do digital touch-up or color work on whichever piece I&amp;rsquo;m working on) and this little old guy here, Herotodus (named after the ancient Greek historian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;floatleft caption&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;a href= &#34;/blog/0001/setup4.png&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;/blog/0001/setup4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Eiffel tower&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The ol&#39; battlestation. Herotodus (the computer) sitting on Goliath (the secretary desk), ready for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it involves me having to do some writing in any form, be it research for a new book, bullet journalling, hacking away on the website or other development projects, working with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&#34;&gt;index card catalogue that I use in lieu of a functioning memory&lt;/a&gt;, or even reading a bit, Herodotus and Goliath (the secretary desk she sits on) is the dynamic duo I turn to. I&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to do quite a bit with Winetricks to get some of my favorite classic games running, so you can often catch me in the mornings in the studio playing a hand of Cribbage or Spades or running through some old text adventure games as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client&#34;&gt;thin client&lt;/a&gt; is that you can fit the little guys damn near anywhere&amp;ndash;in a drawer, wedged between some books, mounted underneath the desk, or really anywhere you can think of that you can pipe some cords out of. I can&amp;rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m a strict observer of the teachings of the Church of Cable Management, but I am someone who believes in doing the equivalent of &amp;ldquo;going on Christmas and Easter to see Grampa and take a family photo in the name of keeping up appearances&amp;rdquo;. Some rubber bands, a bit of &amp;ldquo;shove the cables in back of stuff&amp;rdquo; and the old &amp;ldquo;wrap the cords around the monitor&amp;rdquo; trick are more than enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herotodus is hooked into an old-school 4:5 aspect ratio monitor I snagged from an old job I worked at. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s neurodiverse impulse, writer&amp;rsquo;s habit &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jeremyutley.design/blog/the-daily-discipline&#34;&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&amp;rsquo;s old &amp;ldquo;yellow legal pads&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, or just plain old aesthetics, but I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to function with anything involving getting words or code down if I&amp;rsquo;m not typing it out on a clicky keyboard and seeing it displayed on a 4:3 or similar aspect ratio monitor. 16:9 doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it for me, for some reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fair share of CRTs as well over the years&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re just easier on the eyes, at least for me&amp;ndash;but not only will one not fit on top of Goliath at any viewable angle but the only one I have currently seems to have burnt out. (Quite frankly, I&amp;rsquo;d use my ancient Brother WP-3550 as a daily driver if I could&amp;ndash;but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for when I inevitably get around to spending a post opining about my typewriter and word processor collection.) This ancient HP 1755 does its job though, and I do love its side-mounted USB ports for transferring files and what-not, as well as its sturdiness. The old girl&amp;rsquo;s built like a tank. I&amp;rsquo;ve always admired that in a lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  My favorite Monday morning pasttime, Sierra Online&#39;s &#34;Hoyle Card Games 2005&#34;, running through &lt;a href=&#34;https://winehq.org&#34;&gt;Wine.&lt;/a&gt; Yes, you can have your table partner be a giant grizzly bear. Yes, he talks. His name is Harley. No, I&#39;m not happy about this hand either.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as software goes, I use a plethora of open-source software in my daily workflow. The entire system itself is a weird frankenstein monster of piping &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Airblader/i3&#34;&gt;i3gaps&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xfce.org/&#34;&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://feeblenerd.blogspot.com/2015/11/pretty-i3-with-xfce.html&#34;&gt;The Feeble Nerd&amp;rsquo;s post on the subject&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know how to set that up&amp;ndash;with a good amount of UI/UX customizations as well. Me being the absolute fruit I am (and also prone to headaches when confronted with any color emanating from a screen writ large that isn&amp;rsquo;t a variation upon a theme of black or grey), I&amp;rsquo;ve customized almost the entire thing in the pinkest and purplest colors I can find and installed a bunch of plugins and custom themes to ensure I never have to deal with &amp;ldquo;light-mode&amp;rdquo; anything if I can avoid it. At some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably clean up and upload my config files to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sarahallenreed&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; so anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested can clone them and customize them to their liking; if that happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll link it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical software, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gimp.org&#34;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; for graphics editing and tinkering with larger UI elements, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vscodium.com/&#34;&gt;VS Codium&lt;/a&gt; with a Vim emulation plugin for programming and other code manangement work (although &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/&#34;&gt;I used Atom until the crooks bought out Github and sunsetted the poor thing&lt;/a&gt;; RIP to the best IDE I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used), &lt;a href=&#34;https://novelwriter.io/&#34;&gt;novelwriter&lt;/a&gt; for long-form document editing and planning (i.e. graphic novels, games, and other things that require keeping track of characters, settings, and concepts) &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghostwriter.kde.org/&#34;&gt;ghostwriter&lt;/a&gt; for shorter-form Markdown pieces (like this blog here!) and a few other odds and ends here and there for other workflow-related things. I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.winehq.org/&#34;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dosbox.com/&#34;&gt;DosBox&lt;/a&gt; to emulate old PC games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mednafen.github.io/&#34;&gt;Mednafen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carpeludum.com/kega-fusion/&#34;&gt;Kega-Fusion&lt;/a&gt;, and a couple other emulators for console games, and I do play a fair amount of Linux games as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/&#34;&gt;PySolFC&lt;/a&gt; is a perennial favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re moving studios (and states!) in a few months here, and while I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to carting an entire secretary desk and an army of computers, typewriters, and sundry halfway across the country for the umpteenth time, I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly imagine studio life without them. (Plus, I need the typewriters to give you folks half the lettering that shows up in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourladymaven.com/&#34;&gt;Our Lady Maven!&lt;/a&gt; It just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same if I used a font&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how often I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating this blog, but seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have Twitter anymore (which means I don&amp;rsquo;t have many other outlets to talk about games, books, and records I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by in the studio), I can&amp;rsquo;t look you in the eye and tell you I&amp;rsquo;m completely invested in keeping Instagram around, and after years of having to use social media as a professional in this industry I&amp;rsquo;ve been burnt out to all hell on the entire concept, this is more or less going to be what I use to keep y&amp;rsquo;all updated.
A large part of my struggle over the past couple years has been balancing the need for a &amp;ldquo;professional freelance illustrator branding&amp;rdquo; with the part of me that genuinely loves and wants to talk about creative pursuits, weird inspirations, and the troubles, tribulations, and triumphs of life that inspire a lot of my work in an honest and genuine manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through a lot of different thoughts on how to tackle that problem, but this is probably gonna be how I do that, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try and update it at least a couple times a month to let y&amp;rsquo;all know what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, what I&amp;rsquo;ve been enraptured in, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You definitely don&amp;rsquo;t have to read every single post on here if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to, but hopefully this will be a nice little window into the life and thought process of the giant dork who pens and voices what (I&amp;rsquo;d hope) are some of your favorite comics, books, and radio shows. If you want to get ahold of me to ask some questions about whatever it is I wrote about, request a topic for me to write a bit about (ask me about bits of my artistic process, for instance) or just send me a letter, you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://sarahallenreed.com/resume/bio&#34;&gt;my current mailing and email address over on the About Me page on my portfolio site.&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do a lil&amp;rsquo; letter column if I get enough mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re all amazing and don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re not. Talk soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;SARAH&lt;/p&gt;
