 Some pretty goosies.

      <description>November 2 
 November 2nd is Prey Day, of course, so that narrows down today&#39;s background noise material.  
 The task was to do as much as I could to update the blog. I didn&#39;t get as much done as I&#39;d like, but progress is progress.   
 The drawing board covered in last month&#39;s completed pages.  
 Also, today I tried to take a photo of Polly with Imogen.</description>

      <description>Mister Pliskin sez it&#39;s new rekkids day.  
 What&#39;s in the baggie? Who can say!   
 Let&#39;s take a gander, shall we?  
 First up: my third favorite Yes record, 90125.  I used to have this one (and Fragile, my second favorite Yes record) on cassette years back when i owned a shitty Toyota Corolla with a tape deck. I&#39;ve been looking for a replacement copy ever since, and while this isn&#39;t exactly a cassette I&#39;m glad to finally have it in the collection.</description>

      <description>Drafting, Pencilling, and Inking 
 Starting in on pencils. The lettering and all that was done (as always) on graph paper and glued up as I went; for a more in-depth look at how I do that, check out this process thread.  
 Here&#39;s the rest of the lettering, glued up and into place.  
 Starting in on inks.  
 Two passes later. I was originally going to black the entire poster&#39;s background out, but I decided to sketch in some variations in tone for the sky and trees as opposed to simply a blacked-out sky covered in snow.</description>

      <description>Initial pencils and lettering.  
 Starting in on inking.   
 First and second pass of inks down. I wanna point out here that the lil&#39; guy there in the witch&#39;s hand was designed by Datafruits&#39; own Zaxy. His name is Beamsprout, if you were curious.  
 As with nearly everything else, I&#39;m doing the lettering by hand.
 
 Inking the lettering.</description>
