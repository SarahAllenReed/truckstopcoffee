      <description>Part one of a series of progress photo galleries of me working through Our Lady Maven, Issue 2.
 
 Hand-lettering, as usual. It&#39;s how we do it here.  
 Pencilling in a facsimile of the Chicago skyline.   
 Roughing in the other two panels.  
 Blocking in the kids with some more rough pencils. I&#39;m using a General&#39;s carpenter&#39;s pencil here to scratch in some shading to mark where I&#39;m going to put some thick swatches of black ink.</description>

      <description>Part two of two sets of progress photos of me working my way through the concept art for The Garden.
 
 Initial pencils for the concept art for Kaia here.  
 Pencilling in the adults....  
 ...and the other kiddos.  
 Adding in some inks on the concept art of the adults. 
 
 Inked kiddos. Karina, Penny, and Bobbie on the top, and a full sheet of Kaia on the bottom.</description>

      <description>Part one of two sets of progress photos of me working my way through the concept art for The Garden.
 
 The initial pencils for the concept art image. I hid [Gnome Chompski](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Garden_Gnome) in there somewhere--see if you can find &#39;im!  
 Starting in on inks, going section by section.  
 Layer layer layer  
 Most of the sections are filled in now; only a few more adjustments then it&#39;s digitization time.</description>

      <description>Some in-progress photos of me working my way through Our Lady Maven Issue 1.
 
 Inking panels from the comic.  
 Full art for Page 8.  
 Close up inks. You can see the ink smudges from the typewriter real well here.  
 Probably my favorite panel.

      <description>Polyhymnia was supposed to be a service dog for my autism and PTSD, but the training she was supposed to get never actually happened. So now she&amp;rsquo;s just my favorite dumbass who tries her best. Here&amp;rsquo;s some cute photos of her over the years.

      <description>For whatever reason, a lot of folks seem to be fascinated with knowing what folks who create things look like. I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood it&amp;ndash;partially because I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly the type of artist known for going out of her way to look remotely presentable&amp;ndash;but for those of you curious, here&amp;rsquo;s a tiny little selection of self-portraits and press photos I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken over the years.
