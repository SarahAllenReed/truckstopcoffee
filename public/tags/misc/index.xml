      <description>Autumn █████████ and I went out on Christmas Eve to get both of us out of our heads a bit and for me to go shooting. Here&#39;s a little sample of what Imogen and I shot today. All of these were edited with Darktable on Linux Mint.
 
 Some pretty goosies.   
 the gooses are on the looses!  
 Keeping watch.</description>

      <description>November 2 
 November 2nd is [Prey Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Prey), of course, so that narrows down today&#39;s background noise material.  
 The task was to do as much as I could to update the blog. I didn&#39;t get as much done as I&#39;d like, but progress is progress.   
 The drawing board covered in last month&#39;s completed pages.  
 Also, today I tried to take a photo of Polly with Imogen.</description>

      <description>Mister Pliskin sez it&#39;s new rekkids day.  
 What&#39;s in the baggie? Who can say!   
 Let&#39;s take a gander, shall we?  
 First up: my third favorite Yes record, 90125.  I used to have this one (and Fragile, my second favorite Yes record) on cassette years back when i owned a shitty Toyota Corolla with a tape deck. I&#39;ve been looking for a replacement copy ever since, and while this isn&#39;t exactly a cassette I&#39;m glad to finally have it in the collection.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s the baby! Shown here with Vim and Nerdtree, with a tin of Bengal Slices and one of my many pipes.  
 Here&#39;s some screenshots of my original setup, starting with Vim with Startify.   
 Dosbox with Frederick Pohl&#39;s Gateway.  
 Liferea. Due to the Pinephone&#39;s smaller screen, this isn&#39;t the *best* solution for RSS feeds, but I&#39;ve yet to find a CLI one I like.</description>

      <description>Initial pencils and lettering.  
 Starting in on inking.   
 First and second pass of inks down. I wanna point out here that the lil&#39; guy there in the witch&#39;s hand was designed by Datafruits&#39; own Zaxy. His name is Beamsprout, if you were curious.  
 As with nearly everything else, I&#39;m doing the lettering by hand.
 
 Inking the lettering.</description>

      <description>Polyhymnia was supposed to be a service dog for my autism and PTSD, but the training she was supposed to get never actually happened. So now she&amp;rsquo;s just my favorite dumbass who tries her best. Here&amp;rsquo;s yet another gallery worth of cute photos of her over the years.

      <description>Falling down a rabbit hole. Most of these suggestions came from my good buddy Miranda Thomas, who thankfully and helpfully suggested KEH as a reputable used reseller. Which is good, because I sure don&#39;t have new-camera money.
 
 Mama (me) and the baby! Imogen is named after Imogen Cunningham, if anyone was wondering.  
 A glamour shot, taken with my old Oneplus 7 Pro that I&#39;ve used for the past few years.</description>

      <description>Part one of a series of progress photo galleries of me working through Our Lady Maven, Issue 2.
 
 Hand-lettering, as usual. It&#39;s how we do it here.  
 Pencilling in a facsimile of the Chicago skyline.   
 Roughing in the other two panels.  
 Blocking in the kids with some more rough pencils. I&#39;m using a General&#39;s carpenter&#39;s pencil here to scratch in some shading to mark where I&#39;m going to put some thick swatches of black ink.</description>

 Initial pencils for the concept art for Kaia here.  
 Pencilling in the adults....  
 ...and the other kiddos.  
 Adding in some inks on the concept art of the adults. 
 
 Inked kiddos. Karina, Penny, and Bobbie on the top, and a full sheet of Kaia on the bottom.</description>

      <description>Part one of two sets of progress photos of me working my way through the concept art for The Garden.
 
 The initial pencils for the concept art image. I hid [Gnome Chompski](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Garden_Gnome) in there somewhere--see if you can find &#39;im!  
 Starting in on inks, going section by section.  
 Layer layer layer  
 Most of the sections are filled in now; only a few more adjustments then it&#39;s digitization time.</description>

      <description>Some in-progress photos of me working my way through Our Lady Maven Issue 1.
 
 Inking panels from the comic.  
 Full art for Page 8.  
 Close up inks. You can see the ink smudges from the typewriter real well here.  
 Probably my favorite panel.

      <description>For whatever reason, a lot of folks seem to be fascinated with knowing what folks who create things look like. I&amp;rsquo;ve never understood it&amp;ndash;partially because I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly the type of artist known for going out of her way to look remotely presentable&amp;ndash;but for those of you curious, here&amp;rsquo;s a tiny little selection of self-portraits and press photos I&amp;rsquo;ve had taken over the years.
