      <description>What Is The Listening List? In June of 2023, I started making a tiny thread on Mastodon about albums I was listening to in the gym and in the studio. While I tend to listen to music via Newpipe in the gym, I use mocp in the studio. It eventually hit me that I could just keep everything I listen to on MOCP saved in a folder of monthly playlists, and edit them down and put them up here.</description>
