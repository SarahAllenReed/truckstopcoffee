      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Sarah. I&amp;rsquo;m an underground cartoonist, professional illustrator, and wandering ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling stories and creating work for what is basically my entire adult life, and this is where I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to place my thoughts on doing so, as well as ramblings about life in general.
This blog is mainly where I write about things that hold my interest, and is also where I put notes on books, records, and other such things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.</description>

      <description>A Damn Fine Cup Of Truck Stop Coffee (A Bit About This Blog) Why make a blog? To paraphrase the Allman Brothers Band, I was born a&amp;rsquo;ramblin&amp;rsquo;. I have a lot to say that doesn&amp;rsquo;t neatly fit into the thematic bonds of my books, paintings, or records. I also know full well through experience that I&amp;rsquo;m at perpetual risk of watching things I say disappear off the Internet if I don&amp;rsquo;t self-host it.</description>

      <description>The following are links to websites of folks I think are cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use this page to promote social media networks, and the vast majority of folks (specifically, other cartoonists/DJs) I know have social media accounts in place of a website, so this list shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be considered an exhaustive compendium of folks I think are neat. If you&amp;rsquo;re not on this list but think you should be, I probably can&amp;rsquo;t find your website or I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to adding you yet because I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with other obligations.</description>
