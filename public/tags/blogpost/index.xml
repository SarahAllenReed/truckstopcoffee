      <description>Hey ya&amp;rsquo;ll! Sorry for the delay, again, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of studio news, life updates, and the like for ya. This one&amp;rsquo;s a bit long, so settle in and get comfortable.
Also, some things on this list include some heavier topics; I&amp;rsquo;ve went ahead and put a content warning both on those posts and on the titles of the sections in the table of contents, so if you&amp;rsquo;re not in the headspace for some heavier topics you can go ahead and skip past.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re finally settled in&amp;ndash;mostly&amp;ndash;in the new studio1, and I wanted to check in and let y&amp;rsquo;all know what&amp;rsquo;s coming down the pike, what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, and where I&amp;rsquo;m planning on heading next.

      <description>this better not be another cock, mervin  Welcome to How To Cook Shit, a new segment here on the blog where I, for some reason, insist upon sharing some of my favorite recipes with you all. This is my website, though, so you&amp;rsquo;re all going to have to make do.
I spent way too much time in professional kitchens in my twenties when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite pay the bills with my work, and I&amp;rsquo;ve joked constantly about quitting comics forever and opening up a little diner if one of my books ever makes it anywhere near profitability.</description>

      <description>HahaahaAHAAHAA fuck this is late
I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. As much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to, I&amp;rsquo;ve not had much time to pen a long column about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to in my spare time, much less had much spare time to spend. Snakes, Barren, and a couple other upcoming projects have kind of monopolized most of my attention, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late on having a second to sit down and write about fun stuff.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly hesitated to write about this topic; it&amp;rsquo;s a personal one that&amp;rsquo;s heavy even by my standards, and on top of that it&amp;rsquo;s not an easy thing to talk about. With that stated, it has kind of colored my output (when it hasn&amp;rsquo;t outright prevented me from creating work at all) for the past few years, and to be quite frank I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up covering it (or aspects of it) in one of my upcoming books anyways.</description>

      <description>Hey y’all! It’s your favorite dork, back at it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bit of a longer segment this month, so I&amp;rsquo;m breaking my &amp;ldquo;The Finer Things&amp;rdquo; into two segments; &amp;ldquo;Studio News&amp;rdquo;, where I talk about the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and what I&amp;rsquo;ve got in the pipeline, and &amp;ldquo;The Finer Things&amp;rdquo;, where I talk a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to, watching, reading, playing, and smoking.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also got a bit of a long, introspective topic to talk about, but that&amp;rsquo;s getting lopped into its own post as well; it&amp;rsquo;s heavy enough for one of my books, which means that I&amp;rsquo;d rather put it in its own little column instead of putting it in with the lighter things I usually talk about on this blog.</description>

      <description>What is this, exactly? While going through some old files on an old shared network drive trying to track down an old script I&amp;rsquo;m working on re-writing, I found this series of interview answers that I gave for a blog that wanted to interview me.
If that seems a strange way of doing things, it kind of is. It&amp;rsquo;s also more or less the norm on a lot of journalistic outlets nowadays, especially those that cater to small press books and records.</description>

      <description>Quick note - as of me editing this post on March 15, my Instagram account has been reinstated. I&amp;rsquo;m still going to actively avoid using it unless necessary, as I stated in this post, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also added &amp;ldquo;Share To&amp;rdquo; buttons to these blog pages and to the galleries if you wish to show off my work to some folks or talk about what I have to say on this blog.</description>

      <description>The corkracks, sometime in the middle of production of Our Lady Maven.  Hey y’all! It’s your favorite dork, back at it again. I’ve just finished up the final touches on Issue 1 of Our Lady Maven at long last, and I’ve finally got time for a bit of a breather to write a bit about what I’ve been working on, what I’ve been reading when I have a second to sit down and read, what I’ve been listening to in the studio, what I’ve been playing in my wee small hours of the morning before I pass out for the day, and (for those few of you who are curious for reasons other than wondering “what the fuck is wrong with her”) what I’ve been smoking.</description>

      <description>Intro Hey, y&amp;rsquo;all. As you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely noticed, 2022 was&amp;hellip;.well, not a good year for social media. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s on fire, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s been under federal scrutiny for years now, and seeing as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a face for anything but radio, I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered with Tiktok.
So, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally updated my website again, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to just go back to basics and start a little blog here instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more long-winded than most social media sites want me to be as it is, and this kind of format gives me more of an opportunity to write a bit about things I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get the chance to talk about otherwise.</description>
